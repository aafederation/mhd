From birth, people need, want, and deserve love, care, safety, and meaning. In environments of generational trauma, violence, and oppression, however, these needs often go unfulfilled—whether or not our caregivers are making their best efforts—and we can move through life feeling deeply disconnected from ourselves, others, and the world. I use somatic, relational, and behavioral approaches to help clients move past intellectualization towards a deep and compassionate understanding of themselves. I aim to support clients in forming secure relationships where there has been disconnection and shame. In our therapeutic work, I hope to support you in learning how to caringly reparent yourself, feel at home in your body/mind, meet your relationship needs, and skillfully navigate a world that can be incredibly draining and hostile. <br>
I also help clients expand their toolbox of life skills, navigate their nervous systems, and contextualize their experiences within racial capitalism. Over time, I hope that our work together will help you experience love, care, safety, and meaning in the world. <br>
