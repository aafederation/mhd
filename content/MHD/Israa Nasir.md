My work focuses on the roles of culture, family of origin, and society in my clients' lives. I am passionate about helping my clients process the interaction between identity formation, emotional distress, and the first- and second-generation immigrant experience. Likewise, I help my clients gain skills to cope with stressors secondary to life transitions, such as those related to dating/marriage, relocation, professional career changes, and voluntary childlessness. I have particular experience in working with identity formation and healing for the AAPI immigrant (first and second generation).  
In order to meet the needs of my clients, I blend techniques and frameworks from CBT, DBT, psychodynamic psychotherapy, existentialist psychology, and narrative therapy. I tailor my approach to meet your unique needs, goals, and life circumstances.  
I am passionate about helping my clients process the impact of their personal experiences as well as those of prior generations on their life so that they can step forward in life with peace, confidence, and understanding. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Contact me today to learn about how I can help.
