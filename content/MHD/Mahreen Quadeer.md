Iâ€™m a board-certified Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner I have two decades of experience in health care, my specialty is using a holistic paradigm to healing, I approach mental health from a integrative psychiatric approach. My work is grounded in the belief that each person holds an innate ability to heal themselves when provided with a safe, collaborative, and non-judgmental space.
