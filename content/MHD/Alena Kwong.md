Welcome! I am Alena and I am a holistic psychotherapist based in New York City. I have a background in holistic nutrition and wellness coaching and am also a certified yoga practitioner and Reiki energy healer. With that said, I have also immersed myself in the practices of mindfulness, yoga, meditation and other spiritual tools for my own healing journey. I am a firm believer of the interconnectedness of the body, mind, soul and spirit as being part of oneâ€™s innate state of healing and well-being.
