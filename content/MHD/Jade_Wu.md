I’m Dr. Jade Wu, a clinical psychologist specializing in women’s mental health, with years of experience working with women struggling with changes and challenges around fertility, motherhood, health changes, and other major life transitions. <br>
My philosophy is that to thrive, women need to be effective at fixing what we can, and wise about the rest. I understand that navigating relationships, health, work, and parenthood can be overwhelming—I’m going through it too!—and I’m here to support and empower you using evidence-based approaches, including:
\- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
\- Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
\- Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) informed methods
\- Trauma-informed psychotherapy
\- Health behavior coaching <br>
In addition to being a women's mental health specialist, I am Board-certified in behavioral sleep medicine, which means I help people to overcome insomnia and other sleep problems without using medications.
