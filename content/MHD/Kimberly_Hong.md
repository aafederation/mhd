Kimberly is a licensed social worker practicing psychotherapy in NY.  She is a warm, empathetic, and patient therapist who works with meeting where you are at, identifying your goals/needs, and working through with you to be the most confident and best version of yourself.  She received her Master of Social Work (MSW) at NYU Silver School of Social Work, graduating as a fellow in the Zelda Foster Palliative/End of Life Care cohort. <br>
Kimberly has worked in mainly large NY hospital settings and is very familiar with working with populations with oncology and serious/chronic illnesses.  She has a heavy interest in working with grief/bereavement, having run bereavement groups in the past.  She also is interested in working with individuals around the nuances of Asian American identity. <br>
Kimberly's practice style comes from a blend of models, including Cognitive Based Therapy, motivational interviewing, and strengths-based therapy.  Her goal is to make sure sessions are patient-centered and collaborative.  Reach out for a free initial consultation to see if she is a right fit for you! <br>
