I’m here for the clients who feel like they don’t connect to other therapists due cultural barriers. I believe therapy works best when the relationship between the client and counselor is secure and trusting. Clients deserve to enter a therapy space where they can be themselves from the outset, and that is what I strive to provide. You don’t have to code switch or educate me on your life or culture, I get it. I don’t ask my clients to explain their life just tell me how you live it. I share many of the identities that my clients have and I share my earned wisdom and years of expertise with my LGBTQ+ and BIPOC clients. The highest compliment that I can receive is “wow, you get it”. I am licensed in CA (LPCC#4340), OR (C8122), NY (015648), and WA (LH60684311).
