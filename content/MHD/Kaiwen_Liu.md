I am a clinical psychologist licensed in Virginia and New York. My office is located in Harrisonburg, VA, and I provide telehealth services to NY clients. I take an integrative, collaborative, and flexible approach to therapy. I am passionate about creating a safe space where clients can cultivate curiosity about their internal experiences, understand relational dynamics, and develop skills to regulate powerful emotions and change unhealthy patterns. I also help clients address sociocultural factors relevant to their daily lives, such as acculturation, systemic racism, white supremacist culture, etc. <br>
My clinical areas of focus include anxiety, depression, emotion dysregulation, trauma, multicultural issues, and relational concerns such as boundary issues, relational trauma, and patterns of unhealthy relationship with self and/or others. I also have a passion for working with international students, immigrants, and healthcare professionals. <br>
