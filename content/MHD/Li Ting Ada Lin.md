I received my PhD in Combined School/Counseling Psychology at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. <br>
My trauma-informed, integrative approach to therapy (e.g., mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral, dialectical behavioral, relational, humanistic, strengths-based modalities) allows me to tailor treatment to m clients’ needs, values, and preferences. <br>
In my personal life, I enjoy spending time outdoors/nature, singing, snacking, hiking, social media, watching YouTube videos, anime, playing board games, and eating pho. <br>
