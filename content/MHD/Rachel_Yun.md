At Yun Psychiatry, I provide medication management and therapy with an integrative and holistic approach—looking not only at symptoms, but at the whole person. My goal is to support you with evidence-based treatment while deeply respecting your inner world. Whether through medication, therapy, or a combination of both, we’ll work together to create a plan that helps you find balance, resilience, and lasting well-being. <br>
I specialize in the treatment of young adults and adults navigating anxiety, depression, mood disorders, ADHD, life transitions, and identity development. I blend conventional psychiatric treatments—such as medication and psychotherapy—with natural supplements, mindfulness practices, body awareness, and profound conversations about meaning, purpose, and belonging. <br>
Whether we're exploring medication options, engaging in therapeutic dialogue, or sitting with big questions about identity, purpose, and belonging—I strive to create a space that is collaborative, nonjudgmental, and deeply respectful of your path. <br>
