I am an experienced adult mental health nurse practitioner with a strong commitment to providing compassionate and culturally competent care to individuals facing mental health challenges. With extensive clinical experience, I focus on delivering evidence-based treatment tailored to each patient's unique needs. As a fluent Urdu speaker, I am able to connect with and support Urdu-speaking patients, ensuring they feel heard, respected, and understood throughout their mental health journey. My goal is to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone I serve.
