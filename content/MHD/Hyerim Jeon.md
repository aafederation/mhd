Iâ€™m a dual board-certified Psychiatric Mental Health and Family Nurse Practitioner dedicated to helping individuals improve their mental and emotional well-being. With a clinical background in psychiatry, neurology-oncology, and primary care, I bring a holistic perspective on how physical health, serious medical conditions, and life experiences influence mental health. <br>
I provide comprehensive mental health care for adults and adolescents, combining psychiatric evaluation, medication management and supportive psychotherapy. <br>
