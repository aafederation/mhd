I have a Masters in Psychology from Goddard College with a Specialization in Expressive Therapies and I have  worked as an individual and group counselor for over 7 years.  I use traditional talk therapy modalities (CBT, DBT, motivational interviewing and psychodynamic therapy) as well as EMDR ,  drama therapy, creative writing, art-making, meditation and Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy. My sessions are holistically facilitated to support clients in developing insight and solidifying their healing from depression, anxiety, PTSD, trauma, abuse and addiction. I am committed to a trauma-informed, gender-affirming, multicultural, decolonizing approach to mental health counseling and being a therapist. <br>
