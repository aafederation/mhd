Nancy McWilliams once wrote, “Not getting it right, making mistakes, and wishing we had the courage to do it differently is not an indication of an underlying pathology or disease. It is the human condition.” This is a belief I hold at the heart of my therapeutic work. I see therapy as a space where all emotions and new interpersonal experiences are allowed to unfold—where people can start to free themselves from the weight of their past and the grip of their fixed narratives and complex feelings about the future, and move toward a more fulfilling life. As Dorothy Dinnerstein said, “Life is given a shape that extends back into the past and forward into the future.” <br>
I am a licensed psychotherapist trained at Adelphi University, the William Alanson White Institute, and the Ackerman Institute for the Family. My background integrates in-depth training in mental health counseling, interpersonal psychoanalysis, and family therapy. <br>
I work with individuals, couples, and families navigating a range of challenges, including depression, anxiety, migration stress, minority identity struggles, workplace burnout, and relational conflicts between partners or across generations. I approach therapy through a multicultural and interpersonal lens, helping clients reconnect with the strengths and capacities they already carry within them. <br>
