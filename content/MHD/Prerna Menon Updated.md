If you feel shackled by the weight of trauma, anxiety, or depression, & are unsure of your purpose and journey ahead, I see you. I am an NYU-trained Certified Trauma Specialist adept in somatic philosophies and dialectical skill building. I blend a relational approach with professional expertise to help you build clarity of self, personal wisdom, & emotional strength. Through our work, you will find yourself restoring vitality into your life, embracing life's many complexities with renewed passion and joy. I specialize in anxiety, trauma, depression, cultural identity issues, relational issues, and purpose building. <br>
I employ evidence-based methods such as DBT, Internal Family Systems, and somatic practices. In our sessions, you will find a genuine, interactive partner who uses a mix of psychoanalytical talk therapy, a relational orientation, and humor. My goal is to make change feel exciting while holding space for the fears, worries, and setbacks that come with it. <br>
In the safety of an authentic relationship, I will help you develop an integrated, unshackled sense of self, free from the burdens of shame and isolation. I prioritize transparency, invite feedback, and emphasize partnership throughout the therapeutic process. I believe in the core of this work & would be honored to work with you. <br>
