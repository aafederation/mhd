I take on psychodynamic and interpersonal approach to help build deeper connection with yourself- to better understand your feelings, relationships and behavior patterns. I am experienced in working with clients through life transitioning, goal setting and developing skills in coping with struggles in life. I provide treatment in both English and Mandarin.
