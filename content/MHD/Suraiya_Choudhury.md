My name is Suraiya Choudhury, an LMHC from NY. I have been in the field for over 7 years with experience working with community behavioral clinics in person, being supervisor and now opening up my own private practice. I have extensive experience working with clients facing depression, anxiety, trauma, and more, with a specialization in treating OCD through ERP. As a Bengali-speaking therapist, I provide culturally informed care, particularly for the South Asian and Muslim communities.
