PAIN IS INEVITABLE, SUFFERING IS OPTIONAL”-BUDDHA <br>
Being the narrator of your own story is one of the most liberating and empowering experiences in life. Using a holistic approach, I help individuals take back control of their lives, allowing them to live a more purposeful and deliberate existence. While working with my clients, I focus on their strengths allowing them to embrace life beyond their diagnoses.\ <br>
I work with multiple areas of struggle, I specialize in loss, anxiety, chronic illnesses (Parkinson’s Disease & Cancer) and life transitions. I use a person-centered approach by taking cultural, religious and sexual self-identities into consideration.\ <br>
The therapeutic journey is a collaborative and intimate partnership. Using multiple therapeutic techniques every client’s journey is met with empathy and compassion. I believe what makes therapy a positive and growing experience is the connectivity and understanding of the client’s perspective; my goal is to always leave you with trust and validation. <br>
