I am a Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW) with experience providing individual and group therapy to adults (18+) navigating challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and relational concerns. I hold a Master of Science in Social Work from Columbia University and am licensed to practice in New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina. My clinical experience has spanned diverse settings, including community clinics and private practice, and I have had the privilege of working with clients across different cultural backgrounds. <br>
I approach therapy with warmth, curiosity, and a strong psychodynamic foundation, integrating tools from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) when helpful. I believe in exploring the deeper roots of emotional pain, while also offering practical support for managing everyday stressors. My areas of interest include trauma, attachment, identity development, and the nuanced experience of navigating multiple cultures. <br>
