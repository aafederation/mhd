You’ve been feeling anxious and depressed…you need relief but you feel stuck and confused about how to change what’s happened in your relationships. You may even feel guilty for wanting change. You need someone who can understand your experiences, help you see clearly, and provide some direction for what to do next. <br>
I specialize in working with women who are capable and giving—the Emotional Support Human for everyone but themselves. I help them develop the confidence to advocate for themselves as mothers, partners, daughters, and in roles that matter the most. <br>
I am a Certified EMDR Therapist and Certified Perinatal Mental Health Professional specializing in trauma, perinatal (pregnancy and postpartum) mental health, and family issues. I reside in Miami and am licensed in both New York and Florida. I speak fluent Mandarin and love a good Korean drama (that and baking shows)! Talking about womanhood and motherhood make my heart sing. I welcome you to call me for a free 20-minute consultation to discuss your therapy needs. <br>
