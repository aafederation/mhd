As a South-Asian therapist on Long Island, I’m here to provide you with a safe, inclusive space where you can explore your mental health, pursue personal growth, and work through life’s challenges. I understand that managing multiple cultural identities and meeting societal expectations can be complex and overwhelming. Drawing from my own background, I approach our work with cultural humility, honoring the cultural narratives that shape who you are and recognizing how they impact your mental health journey. <br>
In our sessions, we’ll work together to build a strong, trusting relationship that encourages openness and honest exploration of both personal and relational dynamics. My approach is rooted in empathy and compassion, and I’m dedicated to helping you find meaningful change and growth. <br>
I will stay committed to learning and integrating new techniques to ensure that I’m responsive to your unique needs. Together, we’ll work toward fostering resilience, increasing self-awareness, and building a greater sense of well-being. My goal is to empower you to gain insight into your experiences and develop coping strategies that feel authentic to you. <br>
