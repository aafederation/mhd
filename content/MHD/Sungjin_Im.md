I am a licensed psychologist in New York and Kentucky with over 15 years of experience helping individuals navigate trauma, anxiety, depression, and emotional challenges through evidence-based care. My approach integrates psychological science and neuroscience with compassionate, personalized treatment tailored to each client's unique needs. In addition to my clinical work, I am a university professor and researcher with more than 20 peer-reviewed publications and over 40 national and international presentations focused on trauma, mindfulness, and neuroscience-based interventions. I translates this advanced expertise into practical therapeutic strategies that support meaningful and lasting change.
