I am a licensed clinical psychologist in NJ and NY. I have over 12 years of clinical experience at numerous settings including hospitals, clinics, college counseling and in private practice. I am the founder of Meraki Psychology Center and am trained in and practice a variety of evidence-based practices including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). I see individuals and families and hope to provide group therapy options in the near future. I specialize in working with individuals from diverse backgrounds and work with various presenting issues including trauma and abuse, emotion dysregulation, anxiety and mood disorders, OCD, eating disorders and difficulties related to life transitions. I work closely with minority groups regarding cultural and identity related issues. I feel each person is unique and therefore tailor treatment to fit each client’s individual needs. I believes each individual’s identities interact to influence who the person is. I take into account each aspect of a person’s identity and explore this in relation to the existing issues. Therefore, my treatment approach is culturally sensitive and adapted to fit clients’ various identities and needs.
