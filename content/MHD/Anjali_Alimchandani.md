I am an Indian American, queer cisgender woman identified psychologist who has been in the field for 15+ years. I am also a person who stutters. My personal passion for psychology stems from a lifelong quest for my own self understanding and liberation. Whether through my relationships with others, work, or in quiet moments with myself, I am continually striving toward greater self awareness, growth, and freedom. I believe every human being has an innate capacity for growth, and that with the right support and at the time that we are ready, we are able to deepen self awareness and transform even the most difficult  patterns, beliefs, and life experiences into sources of wisdom and power. We are able to live a life aligned with our deepest desires and sense of purpose. I bring this heartfelt passion to my work with each and every client.
