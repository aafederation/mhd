I founded Han Psychotherapy, PLLC in 2023 with the mission of providing empathetic, individualized mental health care. In Korean, the word “Han” carries a profound dual meaningg of both “one” and “deep sorrow". This concept is at the heart of my therapeutic philosophy, recognizing that trauma is not a universal experience but a deeply personal and complex journey. I believe that healing is unique to each individual, which is why I take a collaborative and personalized approach to therapy. My goal is to honor each client’s experiences, foster healing with depth and sensitivity, and provide unwavering support every step of the way. I specialize in trauma therapy for adults, integrating evidence-based and psychodynamic approaches. My approach emphasizes inner child healing while addressing present challenges. I also help individuals manage anxiety, depression, panic attacks, life transitions, marital issues, pregnancy and postpartum concerns, family conflicts, and religious struggles.
