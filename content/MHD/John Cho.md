John Cho is a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (NY) and Licensed Professional Counselor (NJ) serving BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities. In their therapy practice, Meant To Thrive Therapy, John works with individuals and couples to co-create safety in session to begin to address the painful lived experiences and relational patterns that no longer serve them in order to create a deeper relationship with the self and others to begin the process of repair and healing. Johnâ€™s approach works through a holistic lens and is guided by combination of LGBTQ+ Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) techniques. John is also grounded by an anti-racist, anti-oppressive, and trauma-informed framework and lived experience as an Korean-American queer person.
