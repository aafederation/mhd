I am passionate about supporting people finding their strength to thrive in difficulties, to be free from past trauma or troubling patterns. I am trained in theories that cultivate healing and a healthy sense of self. Come and learn how to make peace with yourself, how to be the person your soul longs to be, and also how to cultivate healthy and satisfying relationships around you.
