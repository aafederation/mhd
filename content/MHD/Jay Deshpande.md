Most often, I work with individuals who feel stuck in some way. Whether you are dealing with relationship issues, life transitions, stress, problems with work, depression, anxiety, cultural conflicts, or something elseâ€”we can address it together, helping you to feel less alone. My style is gentle, supportive, and emotionally attuned; I am curious to understand you on your own terms. As we build a therapeutic relationship we can explore where and how you feel most alive, and how to make use of that in the challenges you face.

I provide psychodynamic therapy, which means we look at both the present and the past to better understand where you are now. I often support people from marginalized identities who have not previously tried therapy. Through my background as an educator, I have extensive experience with adolescents, young adults, and people wrestling with their creativity.

Starting work with a new therapist takes a great deal of energy and motivation. I believe meaningful change comes from investing in relationships, including this one. I provide a non-judgmental space so we can be curious together and face the road ahead. My hope is to listen to you in a new way as you move toward greater fulfillment in your life.

I hold degrees from Harvard, Columbia, and NYU. Currently I work in private practice and as an analytic candidate at the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy.
