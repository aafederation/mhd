Dr. Raman Kaur Mohabir is a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) in the state of New York, a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor (LPCC) in the state of California, and a Nationally Board-Certified Counselor (NCC). She received her MS. ED in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from St. John’s University and her PhD from Montclair State University.
\<br?>
Dr. Mohabir has been a member of the Association of Death Education and Counseling (ADEC) since 2018 and has been awarded the distinction of Fellow in Thanatology (FT in the study of Death and Dying). With over 10 years in the field of grief counseling, she has extensive expertise providing individual and group therapy. She has many years of experience in the hospice setting working with end-of-life patients, anticipatory grief with those impacted throughout the end of life experience, and bereavement support following a death. Furthermore, she has experience providing grief support to pediatric hospice families following the death of a child. <br>
She has also presented at national and regional conferences, published research and scholarly work related to grief and bereavement and co-taught a grief counseling course at Montclair State University. Her research focuses on various grief related phenomena which have been published in the Journal of Counseling and Development and the OMEGA: Journal of Death and Dying. Moreover, she engages in scholarship focusing on cultural and religious influencing factors on the grief process, with particular attention to the grief experiences of her own Sikh community. <br>
Raman specializes in grief and loss, life transitions, and identity exploration. Her work centers on helping adults navigate the emotional, relational, and existential shifts that often follow a significant loss. Together, she supports clients to make sense of the many layers of grief—whether it’s the loss of a person, a role, a future you imagined, or a part of yourself. She offers education on grieving styles and models, but more importantly, she helps you honor your own process. Raman’s approach is collaborative, compassionate, and nonjudgmental. <br>
