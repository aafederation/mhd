I specialize in helping high-achieving professionals who feel stuck, burned out, or disconnected from themselves or others. I am a relational psychotherapist, which means I believe healing and change happen through relationships—including the one you have with yourself. Therapy provides that space—a safe, co-created connection where you feel seen, supported, and challenged to grow. I specialize in working with people who feel disconnected from their core selves. That disconnection can show up as burnout, anxiety, depression, substance dependence, relationship struggles, perfectionism, people-pleasing, anger outbursts, AuDHD masking, or forms of self-sabotage. In our work together, we’ll unpack the beliefs and internal roadblocks that keep you feeling stuck. <br>
Before becoming a therapist, I practiced corporate litigation and ran my own food business, so I understand firsthand the toll that pressure, ambition, and isolation can take—even when things look “successful” from the outside. My approach is direct, collaborative, and non-judgmental. Together, we’ll build self-awareness, manage difficult emotions, and develop practical tools so you can meet challenges with more clarity, presence, and ease. <br>
