Healing is not just about solving problems or “fixing” symptoms or issues, but about reconnecting with our truest, most authentic selves. You are already a whole human being, and our work together will call upon the deep wisdom, intuition, and capacity for healing already within you. Our sessions are a co-created space where we (hopefully) build trust, uncover your strengths, and explore what is no longer serving you. We may also dive into the past and see how it’s affecting your present. But always, we will navigate your inner world with patience, vulnerability, and a sense of sacredness. <br>
I specialize in helping individuals navigate anxiety, depression, trauma, and PTSD using a psychodynamic and relational approach. By exploring past experiences and fostering a deep therapeutic connection, I help clients gain insight, heal emotional wounds, and build healthier relationships with themselves and others. <br>
I am currently working with out-of-network benefits. My office would be happy to help you maximize your insurance benefits. To see my current availability and schedule an appointment please visit my website. <br>
