Welcome! If you’re searching for a therapist who goes beyond traditional talk therapy, you’re in the right place. I specialize in supporting BIPOC, LGBTQIA+ individuals, immigrants, and TCKs (third-culture kids) to navigate and heal the root causes of anxiety and distress. Whether it’s the weight of systemic oppression, workplace stress, past traumas, attachment wounds, or relational challenges, I’m here to walk alongside you. Together, we’ll get to the heart of what’s holding you back so you can reconnect with your authentic self and move forward with clarity and strength. <br>
In our work, I integrate creative, somatic, and experiential approaches like Brainspotting and drama therapy, all grounded in a trauma-informed, culturally sensitive framework. This is a space for more than just talking—it’s a space to feel, express, and release what has been buried or unspoken. <br>
If you’re ready to dive deeper into your healing journey and uncover the root causes of your pain, let’s connect. It would be an honor to guide and support you. <br>
