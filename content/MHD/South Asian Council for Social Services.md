South Asian Council for Social Services (SACSS) is a not-for-profit community-based organization (CBO) serving South Asian and other underserved immigrants in New York City from the past 19 years. Our mission is to empower and integrate underserved South Asians and other immigrants into the civic and economic life of New York. We assist individuals and families in the areas of healthcare access and awareness, connect them to various benefits, provide senior support services, promote civic engagement, and advocate for social justice. All of SACSSâ€™ programs are free and are provided by culturally competent staff members who speak 11 different South Asian languages.
