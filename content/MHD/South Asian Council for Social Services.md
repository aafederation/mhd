South Asian Council for Social Services

  
 South Asian Council for Social Services (SACSS) is a not-for-profit community-based organization (CBO) serving South Asian and other underserved immigrants in New York City from the past 19 years. SACSS was founded in 2000 in response to critical issues raised around the tremendous barriers to social services faced by New York City’s fast-growing South Asian community. Our mission is to empower and integrate underserved South Asians and other immigrants into the civic and economic life of New York. SACSS’ target Diaspora comprises immigrants and their children hailing from the South Asian region which includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bhutan, and the Maldives. It also includes Indo-Caribbeans who are individuals from Caribbean nations who trace their heritage back to South Asia. We assist individuals and families in the areas of healthcare access and awareness, connect them to various benefits, provide senior support services, promote civic engagement, and advocate for social justice. We also provide basic and advanced English and computer courses and run the first South Asian food pantry in New York. All of SACSS’ programs are free and are provided by culturally competent staff members who speak 11 different South Asian languages. Through our various services, each year we serve over 15,000 clients each year.
