My therapy practice is grounded in building meaningful collaborative relationships with my clients since I believe communication is the foundation for insight and growth. I respect each client’s individuality and aim to support people in becoming the best version of themselves. I strive to create a space where people feel comfortable expressing themselves honestly and it’s possible to better understand, navigate, and heal from challenging experiences over time. 

It is important to me to acknowledge the impact of socioeconomic and historical conditions on people’s lives. I am particularly committed to supporting people of color and others from marginalized communities to overcome trauma and hardships and experience more joy, love, and fulfillment in their lives.
