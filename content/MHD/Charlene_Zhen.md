I work with adult children of immigrants, young professionals, and couples navigating anxiety, depression, intergenerational trauma, and family conflict. Before becoming a therapist, I worked in corporate and start-up environments, which gave me a firsthand understanding of the stress, burnout, and pressures of perfectionism that often come with a fast-paced, demanding career.  My approach is grounded in psychodynamic therapy—we’ll explore how early relationships and past experiences shape your present thoughts, emotions, and patterns. Together, we’ll look beneath the surface to understand what keeps repeating, what feels stuck, and what’s been hard to name.
