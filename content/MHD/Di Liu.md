Hello, and welcome. I’m a warm and compassionate licensed Clinical Psychologist, offering psychotherapy in both English and Mandarin for adults, children, and families. I specialize in treating depression, anxiety, trauma, and intense emotional states like fear, anger, hopelessness, and shame. I support individuals navigating life transitions—such as parenthood, relationship changes, career shifts, or immigration—and help them reconnect with resilience and meaning. <br>
My approach integrates relational, humanistic, trauma-informed, mindfulness, and DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) principles, always tailored to your unique needs and goals. Together, we may explore past wounds, the dynamics of your relationships, or develop practical tools to stay grounded and present. At the heart of my work is a commitment to fostering trust, connection, and self-compassion. <br>
As an Assistant Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, I supervise and teach Psychology and Psychiatry trainees, and my involvement in psychotherapy research—especially on the therapeutic alliance—continually enriches my clinical work. <br>
As an immigrant and a father, I bring lived experience to the complexities of cultural adaptation, identity, and caregiving. 如果您希望用母语交流，我也提供普通话的心理治疗。 <br>
It would be my honor to accompany you on your path toward healing, growth, and greater authenticity. <br>
