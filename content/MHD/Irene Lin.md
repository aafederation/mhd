Navigating anxiety, depression, cultural identity struggles, self-esteem, and neurodivergence can be challenging. I connect best with Asian Americans, whether you moved here at a young age or grew up in an Asian household. I understand that cultural nuances can play a big part in overcoming many obstacles. I offer counseling in Mandarin and English in a safe and non-judgmental space. You may feel stuck between expectations and self-discovery. Iâ€™m here to help you build resilience, confidence, and a sense of belonging.
