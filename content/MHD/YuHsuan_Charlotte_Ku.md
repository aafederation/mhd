Hi, my name is Charlotte! I am a licensed mental health therapist in the state of New York. I have been in practice for 4 years and have been providing therapy to adults who are going through struggles in life. I believe therapy is a safe space for clients to express feelings and learn more about themselves. I invite clients to engage in the therapeutic process and become more aware and curious about their unresolved past issues. <br>
In practice, I utilize an integrative approach including Psychodynamic, Person-Centered, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I am warm, genuine, and curious. My therapeutic approach is tailored to clientsâ€™ needs. I believe the uniqueness of each client is what makes therapy special. In addition, I specialize in working with clients who are going through relationship issues, life transitioning, adjustment, depression and anxiety. Through working collaboratively with me, I will explore recurrent behaviors and thought patterns that are crucial in life and provide new insights to help clients gain a better understanding of themselves and their relationships. <br>
I received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Stony Brook University and a Master of Arts in Psychological Counseling from Columbia University in the City of New York. I am currently receiving post-grad training in the Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy Program at William Alanson White Institute. I am fluent in Mandarin & English and provide therapy in both languages. <br>
