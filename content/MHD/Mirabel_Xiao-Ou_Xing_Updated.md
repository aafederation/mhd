As an immigrant, Third Culture Kid (TCK), and former international student, I recognize that each person’s identity and experiences are nuanced and multilayered. My past careers as a journalist and teacher have shown me that while our narratives are unique and powerful, we all share a universal desire for self-understanding, insight into the human experience, and meaningful connections with emotional support. <br>
I help individuals and couples through life transitions, interpersonal conflicts, stress, anxiety, loneliness, grief, and loss. My style is relational, strength-focused, culturally sensitive, and trauma-informed, influenced by psychodynamic theories, existential psychotherapy, and DBT. I'm currently pursuing training in IFS. <br>
I’d be privileged to walk this journey with you. <br>
I am in-network with Aetna, Cigna, Wellfleet, Evernorth, and Meritain Health. <br>
