Sometimes life has a way of throwing us off balance and finding our way back can be overwhelming & challenging. As a LMSW, I work to create a safe environment to support you on finding your way back to your best self. I strongly believe in the power of the therapeutic process & strive to create a warm and empowering space that encourages clients to develop trust, share and process their vulnerabilities and traumas, and achieve life long growth. I believe that clients are the authors to their lives while understanding that therapy isn't a one size fits all model. I work to tailor each session to meet the client's needs.

As a first generation child of two parents who immigrated from Pakistan, I recognize the challenges and barriers placed upon a community who lacked access to mental health resources. Resources that could have change the outcome of their own lives. I strongly believe in the voices of those who have been oppressed and have not had the privilege to resources that may change their lives. As a strong advocate for the BIPOC community, I believe it is my duty as a social worker to create a voice for the voiceless and advocate for those who are unable to do so for themselves.

<br>

I have experience working with teens, young adults, adults, & families. I utilize a client centered, strength based approach with CBT, Attachment Theory, & a Trauma Focused lens, to support clients in achieving life long growth. As a certified yoga teacher, I frequently utilize mindfulness and meditation techniques throughout sessions to attain stability.

<br>

I have supported clients who have struggles with PTSD, ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, Life Transitions, Relationship Challenges, Communication, and everyday life stressors. Sometimes showing up is the hardest part & it would be my privilege to walk along side you throughout this journey of self reflection & growth.
