I offer a unique and diverse perspective, enriched by my international background and nine years of experience in the legal and finance sectors in New York. This professional journey has given me deep insight into the complexities of life transitions and work-related challenges, which I integrate into my counseling practice. I have experience working with clients navigating a range of issues, including trauma, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, low self-worth, addiction, relationship challenges, and life transitions. I work primarily with adolescents, adults, and couples.
