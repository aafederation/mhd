Everyone needs support during difficult times in their lives, whether they are dealing with relationship issues, stress at home or work, or feelings of depression and anxiety with or without a clear cause. It is during times like these that therapy can help. Through our work together I will provide a safe space for painful memories and emotions to be explored and work with you to gain a deeper understanding of how these experiences continue to shape you today. Together we will work to help you develop new coping skills and bring an enhanced level of self-awareness to your life. <br>
I have extensive experience working with both adolescents and adults struggling with depression, anxiety, relationship issues, and cross-cultural challenges. My experience working within both acute and ambulatory care medical settings has also expanded my expertise to include helping those coping with chronic illness, grief/loss, and end of life issues. <br>
I offer video/teletherapy to clients residing throughout New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and DC where I am licensed as well as in person sessions at my office in Washington DC. Please feel free to contact me to schedule an in-person or online consultation to learn more about my approach to therapy. I look forward to hearing from you. <br>
