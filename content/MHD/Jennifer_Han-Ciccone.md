Clients can count on me to listen with an open mind and collaborate with them to develop a personalized plan of action that fosters motivation and improvement in their daily lives. I have experience working in outpatient mental health hospitals, and mental health and substance abuse clinics, and nonprofit organizations. Additionally, I am trained in EMDR and Progressive Counting. I am deeply passionate about learning new therapeutic methods to best support my clients, helping them grow, flourish, and move toward empowerment and independence.
