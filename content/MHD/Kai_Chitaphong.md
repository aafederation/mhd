As a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) and PhD with over 20 years of experience, I am dedicated to helping individuals, couples, and families navigate through life's challenges. With a background as a social worker in the military, I bring a unique perspective and deep understanding of the specific stressors faced by military personnel and their families. My therapeutic approach is rooted in empathy, respect, and collaboration, creating a safe and non-judgmental space for clients to explore their concerns. <br>
I have a passion for working with couples and helping them improve their relationships. Whether you are facing communication difficulties, conflicts, or a loss of intimacy, I provide a supportive environment to explore underlying issues and develop effective strategies for building a stronger connection. I also specialize in working with college students and professionals in demanding environments. I provide a compassionate and understanding space to address stress, burnout, time management, career transitions, and work-life balance challenges. Together, we can explore practical techniques to enhance your well-being and success. <br>
My therapeutic approach is integrative, drawing from various modalities tailored to meet the unique needs of each client. I believe in fostering a strong therapeutic relationship built on trust, empathy, and mutual respect. I combine evidence-based practices with a strengths-based perspective, empowering clients to tap into their inner resources and develop practical skills to navigate life's challenges. <br>
Therapy is a collaborative journey, and I am committed to providing a safe and supportive environment where you can explore your concerns, gain insights, and achieve personal growth. Together, we will work towards fostering positive change and enhancing your overall well-being. <br>
I warmly welcome you to reach out and begin your journey towards a happier and more fulfilling life. <br>
