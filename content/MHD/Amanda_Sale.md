As a queer, first-generation Chinese-Mexican American, I have a deep understanding of the complexities involved in navigating intersecting identities within both interpersonal relationships and systemic structures. This lived experience shapes my commitment to reimagining family and intergenerational community through a queer lens, while actively resisting white supremacy and colonialism. My work is rooted in creating spaces for healing, connection, and support beyond dominant cultural norms. In our work together, we will co-create the therapeutic process to your unique needs, values, and goals, fostering a space that feels both safe and empowering. <br>
Amanda has experience working with individuals and families navigating depression, anxiety, the impacts of forced migration, life and relational transitions, and intergenerational family systems. She integrates traditional therapeutic approaches -including psychoeducation, narrative therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) - with holistic practices such as mindfulness, somatic awareness, and attention to the mind-body connection. Her approach supports healing that honors the full complexity of each person's lived experience. <br>
Education:
Amanda received her Master in Social Work from CUNY Hunters Silberman School of Social Work and her B.S. in Social Work and Global Public Health from New York University. She also holds a certification in LGBTQ+ Affirmation Therapy from the Institute of Human Identity.
Amanda  is a licensed mental health counselor in the states of New York
