I am a Cornell-trained therapist and psychiatrist offering talk therapy, medication management, or combination treatment. My identities include being a person of color, child of immigrants, and community organizer. I help my patients navigate anxiety, burnout, depression, relationship difficulties, trauma, chronic pain (e.g. IBS and migraines), and more. We work together on developing self-understanding, more fulfilling relationships, and greater agency in life. <br>
Therapy with me is a collaborative process to identify repressed emotions and root-issues. When relevant, sociopolitical influences are also addressed. My training and experience allows me to fluidly move between therapy and medication management. If medications are involved, they are often reduced as the therapy progresses. <br>
Feel free to reach out to me, and we can schedule a 30 minute complementary call to introduce ourselves, discuss your goals, and identify a path forward. <br>
