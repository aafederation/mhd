Hi, my name is Isabel. I am a licensed clinical social worker with over 15 years of clinical experience. I have undergone intensive training in play therapy, parenting strategies, and holistic healing, allowing me to offer a compassionate and well-rounded approach to care, providing individual, couples, and group therapy. In the later part of my career, I have take on leadership roles as a clinical supervisor, providing guidance to early childhood social workers at the New York City Department of Education, mentoring master-level social work students at Columbia University, and delivering clinical training to other mental health professionals.
