I’m Na, and I’m a trilingual therapist (Korean and Mandarin) and Licensed Clinical Social Worker offering online therapy across New York State. <br>
I hold a degree in Social Work from Columbia University and bring over 8 years of experience supporting clients of all backgrounds, ages, and identities. <br>
I'm especially passionate about working with AAPI communities, first- and second-generation immigrants, BIPOC clients, and the LGBTQIA+ population. My areas of focus include anxiety, depression, racial identity development, gender-affirming therapy, immigration trauma, intergenerational trauma, and women’s mental health. <br>
I believe that representation matters—deeply. As a queer, bicultural therapist, I’m committed to building genuine therapeutic relationships rooted in inclusivity, safety, and a sense of belonging. I honor the dignity of every person and believe in the transformative power of community-based healing. <br>
If you're looking for a therapist who values cultural humility, trauma-informed care, and the pursuit of authentic self-expression, I’d be honored to walk alongside you. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect. <br>
