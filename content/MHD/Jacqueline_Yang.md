I have experience working with presenting concerns around anxiety, depression, interpersonal and relational issues, and identity development. I also have experience working with LGBTQ+ populations, as well as racial and ethnic minority groups - particularly those who have been socialized in bicultural or multicultural settings.

I received my Master of Education (EdM) and Master of Arts (MA) in Mental Health Counseling at Teachers College, Columbia University, with an Advanced Certificate in Sexuality, Women and Gender with a focus on LGBTQ+ Issues.
