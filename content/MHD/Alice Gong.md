I recognize the courage it takes to reach out for support, and I hold that trust with deep respect. To me, therapy is a mutual process where we work together to foster understanding and connection. My goal is to create a safe, collaborative space where you can feel supported and truly heard. Since advancements in technology, many people have felt the weight of isolation and the frustration of feeling misunderstood. Navigating life’s transitions—or simply managing day-to-day life—can feel overwhelming when it seems like there’s no one to turn to. <br>
In our work together, I take a psychodynamic approach to help us uncover how past relationships and experiences shape our current thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. Once we gain this insight, I incorporate CBT and DBT techniques to support you in developing healthy ways to cope, modify, and accept these patterns. <br>
I maintain a trauma-informed perspective, prioritizing safety and validation to ensure you feel secure throughout our work. Above all, I focus on what YOU want to achieve. There’s no one-size-fits-all roadmap for life, so I am here to meet you exactly where you are, ready to support your unique journey. <br>
