I am a licensed marriage and family therapist who provides culturally responsive, mindfulness-based therapy for Asian American and South Asian adults navigating anxiety, perfectionism, burnout, relationship stress, and major life transitions. I specialize in working with high-achieving professionals and first-generation individuals who feel caught between cultural expectations, family roles, and their own emotional needs. <br>
My approach is holistic and integrative, drawing from mindfulness practices, somatic awareness, and evidence-based therapy to help clients feel grounded, regulated, and more connected to themselves. I offer a supportive, non-judgmental space where clients can explore identity, cultural stress, intergenerational dynamics, and relationships while building clarity, self-compassion, and resilience. <br>
