I am a bilingual (Cantonese), bicultural (1st generation Asian-American) Clinical Psychologist in CA, CO, WA, TX, HI & NY for over 26 years.  I have worked with clients coming from all walks of life, diverse backgrounds and cultures.  I believe that we all have within us the resiliency and strengths to handle life's challenges, and my goal is to help you rediscover them and walk together with you through those harder moments in life.  I believe that it is through these tough moments that we grow and become the better, stronger persons that we are meant to be.  I accept Lyra (EAP), Aetna, HMSA and any PPO insurance (superbill).
