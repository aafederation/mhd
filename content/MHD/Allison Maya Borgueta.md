I specialize in mental health support for AAPI and multiracial other women in business, STEM, and other demanding fields. Imposter syndrome, anxiety, burnout, chronic stress and perfectionism are common concerns. Many are navigating toxic workplaces, or have experienced corporate trauma such as harassment, discrimination, or bullying. Women of color and first- and second-generation immigrants—who have a unique set of pressures and experiences related to their professional lives—make up a majority of my caseload. <br>
As a psychologist, my goal is to provide you not only with insight and support, but with tools and skills you can use to feel better and move forward. I strive to take a practical approach that blends the science of therapy with warmth, compassion and a sense of humor. <br>
