Maria Gregorio is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker with degrees in psychology, social work and creative writing. She has more than two decades of trauma-informed experience with youth and adults who suffer from depression, anxiety, trauma, PTSD, grief/loss, and other life stressors. With a non-judgmental approach, she helps clients develop confidence, identify strategies for coping, and attain inner strength. She explores not only a person's struggles but also their resilience, with the hope to facilitate healing and self-empowerment. Her practice is founded on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral therapeutic orientations, alongside creative art forms, yoga, meditation and narrative therapy.
