Hello,  I'm Manna Chan. I am dedicated to accompanying you on your journey towards mental well-being. With extensive experience in clinical leadership, I've embarked on a mission to establish a vibrant and inclusive mental health practice, where everyone can access the compassionate support they rightfully deserve. <br>
My Specialty:
As a trauma specialist, I am specialized in caring for individuals experiencing childhood, intergenerational, relational, medical, and sexual traumas. I am also specialized in treating other conditions such as anxiety, depression, grief, chronic pain/illness, maternal wellness, and adjustment to life stressors and changes. <br>
My Treatment Modalities:
As a clinician with over 25 years of experience, I draw from various therapy modalities to provide a comprehensive and individualized approach for my clients. One of the primary techniques I integrate is body-based Somatic Experiencing Therapy. As a Somatic Experiencing Practitioner (SEP), I utilize somatic therapy to regulate the nervous system and the bodily sensations that are associated with trauma responses, aiming to release unresolved tension and emotions. This bottom-up approach has proven to be one of the most effective methods for helping clients address the unresolved tension and unspoken emotions caused by emotional traumas. <br>
Additionally, I employ other evidence-based modalities such as Family Constellation Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Prolonged Exposure, and Motivational Interviewing to address specific concerns that may arise during sessions. <br>
I donâ€™t believe in the one-size-fits-all approach. You are unique, so are your circumstances. Therefore, I tailor my therapeutic approach to best suit your needs. Through careful assessment and collaborative discussions, I determine the most suitable therapeutic techniques and interventions for you. This flexible approach ensures that you receive personalized care that aligns with your goals and preferences.
