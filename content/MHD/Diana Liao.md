I help adults in NY and NJ navigate transitions and challenges related to identity, self-worth, relationships, and career. As a therapist, I strive to provide a safe and nonjudgmental space to support and help you move past fears and obstacles that may be getting in the way of your success and happiness. Weâ€™ll work towards goals such as deepening self-awareness, overcoming unhelpful patterns, learning effective coping methods, cultivating self-acceptance, and building resilience. If any of this resonates with you, schedule a complimentary video consult and take the first step towards feeling better. Learn more at [www.dianaliao.com](http://www.dianaliao.com)
