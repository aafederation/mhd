Living between cultures can be both enriching and challenging. As someone who has moved between China and the U.S., I understand the unique pressures of balancing Asian identity with life in a Western society. Whether you're an international student adjusting to a new country, an immigrant finding your way, or simply someone grappling with life transitions, I'm here to help. I offer sessions in both Mandarin and English to support you in the language that feels most comfortable. <br>
My work extends beyond bicultural individuals. Having fully assimilated into American culture, I understand that change, anxiety, and growth are universal. My inclusive approach supports anyone navigating life’s challenges. I’ll support you in uncovering your strengths and using them to navigate life’s complexities. I also bring unique clinical expertise to help couples enhance communication, connection, and navigate cultural differences. <br>
I use trauma-informed and evidence-based approaches blending mind and body to get real results. Using CBT, we’ll reframe unhelpful thoughts; with ACT, you’ll embrace emotions and commit to values-driven action. EMDR helps process past traumas, while IFS connects and heals different parts of yourself. Every method is tailored to honor your cultural background, ensuring deeply meaningful, effective therapy. <br>
