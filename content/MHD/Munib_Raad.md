As a therapist in practice for 12 + years, I specialize in working with LGBTQ+ POC communities coping with depression, anxiety, relationship stress, racial identity, and spirituality/faith. I have have extensive experience working with Asian Americans and other communities of color, immigrants, Millennials, Gen Z, college students, and healthcare workers. We all need spaces in our lives to be seen and heard. There are times, however, when it can be hard to find those spaces of acceptance, non-judgment, and problem solving. <br>
My approach in therapy focuses on each person's unique stories, strengths, and resilience, from a space of empathy, and concrete tools to move forward. I believe that therapy is a collaborative process that balances spaces of acceptance with change, which is based in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). <br>
I am committed to diverse communities and enjoy working with clients of all racial backgrounds, sexual orientations and gender identities. I believe that therapy should be accessible, which is why I take insurance including Aetna, Oscar, Oxford and United Healthcare through ALMA. Please contact me for insurance information. <br>
