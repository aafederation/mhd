Hi, I’m Aditi, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor based in New York. I provide culturally affirming, identity-conscious therapy to individuals navigating anxiety, relationship challenges, and life transitions. As an Asian American therapist, I understand the nuances of bicultural identity, intergenerational dynamics, and the pressure to meet external expectations while honoring your own values. My approach is collaborative and compassionate, helping you explore patterns, build self-trust, and move toward greater clarity and connection. Whether you're seeking support for your mental health, relationships, or personal growth, I’m here to help you feel heard, empowered, and grounded in who you are.
