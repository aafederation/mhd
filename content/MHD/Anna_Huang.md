I see therapy as a place to process experiences, explore complexity and arrive at new insights that affirm your self-worth. You might be coming to therapy because you feel stuck. You might wonder why you still struggle with anxiety, depression, or a general emptiness or unease despite “knowing better.” Together we can investigate these symptoms, including the ways they’ve served or protected you. I also believe that, when you’re ready, reconnecting to your body and emotions is important for lasting change. <br>
I’m passionate about working with people who’ve been multiply marginalized by white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism and other systems of oppression. We might especially be a good fit if you’re BIPOC, an immigrant/child of immigrants, LGBTQ+, engaged in political or community work, seeking support for anxiety, trauma, life transitions, identity development or professional/career stress. I deeply believe in every person’s capacity to change and heal and would be excited to be part of your journey towards finding more freedom and fulfillment. <br>
I’m committed to anti-oppressive practice which includes challenging the hierarchical and medicalized nature of therapy. I believe autonomy is key to healing and want to empower you to develop your own frameworks for making sense of your life, which can include diagnostic labels or not. I also know that our material conditions matter and have a profound impact on mental health. You’re encouraged to bring your whole self to therapy, including discussing racial trauma, financial stress, burnout, unsupportive family or other challenges. <br>
