Hello! I'm half-Japanese, half-American, and I've worked in the community for over 6 years. I want to help people gain a more complete understanding of themselves, and learn the best ways for themselves to process experiences both good and bad. I hope to help folks develop resilience and coping skills to identify what a rich and meaningful life means to you, and equip you with the tools to get there. <br>
I have helped a lot of folks, both in private practice and community care, work through their anxiety and build up their confidence. I've helped people grow and repair their relationships, and also how to set boundaries and walk away when a relationship is too toxic. I utilize ACT, which is about helping learning how to accept out emotions and gain more control over how we react to them in our lives. <br>
