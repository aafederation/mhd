All of us wish to be seen, heard, and understood, but sometimes the fear of judgment gets in the way of our expression of our true selves and our vulnerability. I am committed to providing a safe and nonjudgmental space for you to give voice to yourself, and for us to collaborate on workable solutions to implement in your school life, work life, and/or relationship with others. <br>
Having worked closely with immigrants in my previous career, I believe that people’s identities and difficulties must be understood in the context of their family, community, and larger culture and society.  My therapeutic approach is integrative and evidence-based. Our work may include the use of CBT, DBT-informed, ACT, CPT and Time-limited Psychodynamic Therapy (TLDP).\ <br>
My goal for you in therapy is to gain a deeper understanding of your thoughts, feelings, and sense of self, learn what works for you in times of distress, and develop a sense of trust in your innate wisdom. <br>
My graduate research was focused on understanding Asian American adolescents’ help-seeking pathways, in hopes of bringing changes to the way schools, families, and communities support their Asian American adolescents with their distress. <br>
