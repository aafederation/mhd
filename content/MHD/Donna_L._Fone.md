I'm a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and provide psychotherapy through a somatic (body-centered) and mindfulness lens. I'm certified in EMDR, Brainspotting, and Hakomi. My approach to healing is informed by attachment theory, neuroscience, trauma-informed approaches, and decades of yoga practice
