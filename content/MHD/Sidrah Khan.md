I am a California and New York licensed therapist specializing in trauma, specifically sexual trauma and intergenerational trauma. As a biracial (South Asian and white) woman who grew up in the US to immigrant parent(s), I understand the complexity of navigating different cultural, religious, social, and familial circles within one's life. Helping individuals work through and heal from trauma--specifically intergenerational trauma--so they can life their fullest lives while still having close relationships, is my passion.
