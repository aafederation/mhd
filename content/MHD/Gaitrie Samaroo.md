My passion has always geared toward a desire to assist others in helping themselves. I believe that everyone should be able to positively live their lives and achieve their goals! Past conflicts, present concerns, cultural and familial expectations, trauma, inter/intrapersonal difficulties - all of these can be so difficult to engage. They do not always have to be. In therapy, we will work collaboratively together to identify and process these thoughts and emotions. It is my biggest hope that I will be able to facilitate and assist in your journey to healing, whatever that may look like!
