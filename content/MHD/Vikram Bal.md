I believe that healing happens as we experience healing relationships. In our time together, we will work to build a trusting therapeutic alliance. The therapeutic process can be a mirror for how you show up for yourself and navigate your personal relationships â€” as we build safety and capacity in the therapy room, you may simultaneously realize that you hold much more safety and capacity within yourself. Together, we will work to find your inner sense of self-compassion, curiosity, and new ways to transcend the obstacles that are holding you back. <br>
I have worked with survivors of sexual assault, violence, and religious/political persecution. I have also worked with LGBTQ+ individuals, first and second-generation immigrants, TCKs, and veterans. As a South Asian man, I welcome conversations about intersectionality, identity, and how our difference/sameness affects the work. <br>
I work primarily from an interpersonal and psychodynamic lens, meaning we look at how narratives and beliefs from your past inform your current patterns. We will also focus on the here-and-now and notice what is happening in the therapy room. <br>
