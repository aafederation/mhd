Dr. Desai specializes in working with individuals who feel depleted by the relentless pursuit of "success" and always being "on."  You're exhausted by forging ahead towards an ever-moving goal post, and when you pause to look around you, you find yourself disconnected from what and who truly matters to you. Sometimes, the wake-up call is forced upon you when youâ€™ve gone through something life-changing that shakes your foundation, resulting in burnout, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress. <br>
During the course of evidence-based virtual therapy, you'll learn the science behind your experiences and strategies for harnessing this insight to drive meaningful change. <br>
