As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) based in New York, I have been providing therapy for the last 10 years. In my decade long career as a social worker I have worked in foster care, hospice care (adults and pediatrics), homeless drop in centers, HIV clinics/hospitals, and elder community centers and nursing homes, providing therapy for people of all age groups and all walks of life. With a focus on social justice and cultural relevance and nuances, all parts of you and your history will be considered and part of the healing process.
