Hi! I'm Heyu Wang, a licensed mental health counselor (LMHC) in New York. I specialize in treating anxiety, depression, intergenerational trauma, family dynamics, and life transitions using a trauma-informed, evidence-based approach. In my work, I aim to create a compassionate and inclusive space where you can slow down, explore your feelings, and reconnect with a deeper sense of wholeness. <br>
I draw from a range of approaches to meet you where you are, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT). I've experience in working with immigrants, people of color, international students, first responders, families, and LGBTQIA+ individuals. <br>
I’m honored to support you in a way that feels culturally sensitive, empowering, and deeply human. I hope this is a place where you feel safe, heard, and supported. <br>
