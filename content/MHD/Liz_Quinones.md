I am a licensed mental health counselor based in Brooklyn focused on creating authentic, collaborative relationships with my clients. As a mixed race (Puerto Rican/Korean) second generation American, I appreciate and am a constant student to the complexities of identity, belonging, and the reality of how systemic inequality impacts someone’s ability to heal. <br>
I use a cultural relational framework, incorporating my training in somatic embodiment and complex trauma to support immigrant and 1st & 2nd generation Americans struggling with trauma, grief, relationship issues, and difficult transitions.  This might mean you’re struggling with estrangement, setting boundaries, navigating conflict, or just find yourself in a dynamic rut. <br>
Together, we will examine the impact of formative relationships and the borrowed dynamics that may live in your relationships to this day. <br>
