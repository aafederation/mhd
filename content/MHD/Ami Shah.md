I’m a clinical psychologist with a specialization in working with adults and geriatric clients with a range of cognitive and socio-emotional challenges. My clinical interests and specialties include treating clients with comorbid anxiety, depression, insomnia, chronic pain, PTSD/trauma, grief and loss, anger and stress management, neurocognitive disorders, caregiver burden (including those caregiving loved ones w/dementia, stroke, TBI), and a range of issues related to multiculturalism in health care.
