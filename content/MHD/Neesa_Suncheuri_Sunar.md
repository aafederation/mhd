Hi! I'm Neesa Suncheuri Sunar, LMSW, a clinical therapist and Native NYCer. I provide trauma-informed and culturally-competent therapy, and have particular expertise and passion for serving the Asian community. I assist clients who experience sadness, stress, grief, confusion, or any misalignment with life. In sessions, I'm here to listen, ask questions, provide feedback if you'd like, and assist with gaining clarity on situations overall. You can explore feelings that otherwise cannot be expressed. <br>
I've worked with people with a range of concerns, including depression, anxiety, anger, and grief. I welcome clients who identify as LGBTQIA+ and/or non-binary. I also welcome neurodiverse clients who are autistic and/or have ADHD; I myself am autistic. <br>
Regarding my Asian identity: I am mixed-race with heritage from Nepal (father) and Europe (mother). My mother has significant Asian influence; previous to my birth, she lived in Kyoto, Japan for 7 years and was married to an Aikido master. I grew up in Bayside, Queens, I attended a thriving Asian neighborhood, and many of my childhood schoolmates came from families from China, Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and many other Asian countries. <br>
I also specialize in the mental health of artists and musicians. I have played violin since the age of 5, and I earned a Bachelors of Music degree in viola performance from the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University Bloomington. I understand the musician lifestyle, the pressures of high-level performing, practicing and auditioning. I also have awareness on the stages of life that a musician goes through from early childhood to adulthood. For therapy work, <br>
My personal worldview and spiritual base is dharmic; this is based on my Nepali heritage where both Hinduism and Buddhism are practiced. I find comfort in maintaining a Hindu practice, and I integrate aspects of Buddhism in my therapeutic work.  I attend continuing education trainings on Buddhist psychology, to refine my understanding of applying dharmic principles to therapeutic practice. <br>
