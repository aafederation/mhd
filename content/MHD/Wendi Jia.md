Hello everyone! My name is Wendi. I’m a licensed mental health counselor in NY. With 7 years of practical experience, I support adults and adolescents through life transitions, relationship challenges, low self-esteem, and trauma. I offer a safe and collaborative space where you can explore your emotions, deepen self-understanding, and move toward the life you want. I would encourage you to define wellness and progress for yourself. <br>
My therapeutic approach is integrative and person-centered with deep appreciation in exploring existential themes. I incorporate psychodynamic insights, strength-based strategies, and practical tools from CBT/ACT/DBT. I listen thoughtfully, ask reflective questions, and help you recognize the stories you’ve been telling yourself. I’m bilingual in English and Mandarin and attuned to the unique layers of cultural identity, immigration, and belonging. My background in engineering, which emphasized structure, balance, and efficiency, also helps me understand the mind and apply considered methods by blending analytical thinking with emotional awareness. <br>
