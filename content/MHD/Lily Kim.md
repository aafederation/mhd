As a Korean-American child of immigrants, I am passionate about working with BIPOC and immigrant individuals who are navigating the liminal spaces between cultures and identities. My approach is trauma-informed and culturally sensitive, integrating narrative therapy, somatic work, and attachment theory. I also have particular experience working with adolescents and young adults, as well as survivors of complex trauma, including hate crimes, interpersonal violence, and sexual assault.
