As your therapist, my role is to hold space for youâ€” space to process, reflect, and examine yourself and what parts of life could be going better. I believe that this process can be a valuable tool to bring you closer to the person you hope to be.

Therapy is not a one-size-fits-all process. I will work with you to create a plan that fits your needs. I utilize a trauma-informed and strengths-based approach integrating evidence-based interventions and the latest research in neuroscience and psychology to better support my clients and their goals.
