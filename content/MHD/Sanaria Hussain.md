I’m a licensed therapist specializing in trauma and relationships. I help individuals and romantic partners navigate emotional and relational triggers, and create a better relationship with themselves and others. I'm experienced in treating trauma, attachment/relationship issues, anxiety, and depression. I use various modalities, including Internal Family Systems and Somatic Attachment, to help clients tune into their inner experience, access deeper awareness, and cultivate compassion and healing for their past and present wounds. My practice is rooted in anti-oppressive values; my goal is to create a supportive space for folks who historically haven’t felt safe or affirmed in traditional therapy settings. You deserve a non-judgmental, accepting environment to explore your truest self.
