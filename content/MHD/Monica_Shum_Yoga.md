As a E-RYT速 500 and YACEP速 Yoga Alliance certified yoga teacher, I strongly believe that yoga is one of the best tool for us to learn to heal ourselves.  As a person who walked the path, the body, mind and spiritual connection from practicing yoga is truly beneficial for us to embark the journey of healing and transformation.  My scope of service include teaching meditation, Vinyasa yoga, Hatha yoga, Yin yoga, and Ashatanga yoga.  I am also a wellness coach and public speaker.
