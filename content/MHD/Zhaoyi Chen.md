Life is full of surprises, some joyful, some deeply painful, and sometimes it’s a bit of everything. You may feel overwhelmed by life's demands, such as work, studies, or family responsibilities; you may feel stuck in repeating patterns or relationships; or it has been a struggle to acknowledge what you truly long for. <br>
As a licensed clinical psychologist, I provide psychotherapy in English and Mandarin Chinese. I’m committed to working alongside my clients on this courageous and vulnerable journey of psychotherapy. Together, we’ll work to reconnect with your inner wisdom and authentic self, and empower you to create meaningful changes. With curiosity and empathy, we’ll explore the deeper connections between your current struggles and the needs that lie beneath them. <br>
My therapeutic style is compassionate, interactive, and direct. I listen with openness and without judgment, helping clients not only make sense of their experiences but also develop practical tools to ease emotional distress and foster lasting growth. <br>
