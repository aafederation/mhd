Perhaps you are experiencing a transition, seeking change, or feeling the need to look at neglected aspects of yourself. Do you feel unhappy or ambivalent about your career, studies, or relationships? You may need a space to process grief, loss, or other profound experiences. Whatever the sources of your discomfort, I will listen and notice, inquire and nudge. We can work together to help you gain self-knowledge and skills as you move forward in your life. <br>
Prior to becoming a psychotherapist, I worked in the corporate world in creative strategy. While I found it fulfilling, I wanted to deepen my interest in people's inner lives, and changed careers to become a psychotherapist. For years now I have had the privilege to support others in their growth and healing. I am also a parent.
