Welcome, I'm so glad you are here! As a second-generation Asian American I bring to my sessions compassion and curiosity. I offer both in-person and virtual psychotherapy to help individuals and couples to heal, grow, and feel empowered in their lives. <br>
My practice philosophy is informed by my anti-oppressive, anti-racist, body positive, sex positive and LGBTQI affirmative attitude. My clinical experience encompasses areas such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, self-esteem, relationship issues, family dynamics, parenting challenges, and life transitions. <br>
Through a holistic approach, I support you in enacting meaningful change. <br>
