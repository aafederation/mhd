St. Francis Counseling Center is a not-for-profit parish-based counseling center attached to a large Roman Catholic church in the Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Herald Square area, drawing upon neighborhood parishioners and working commuters from the Tri-State area. We treat adults 21+ on a short and long term basis for adjustment disorders, depression, anxiety, addictions, marriage and couple counseling, and bereavement counseling. Fees are on a sliding scale basis. Our mission is to "provide affordable psychotherapy with a preference for the poor, marginalized and alienated."
