I am an out of network provider.
I believe that the therapeutic relationship is collaborative and transparent. I view the therapist as a guide in your life’s journey, whether your goal is to learn, develop, and strengthen coping skills, gain more understanding about yourself, or process a difficult experience. I like utilizing DB T skills in my practice, along with CBT. Recently, I have been moving more toward including somatic based interventions. I look forward to working with you!"""

My career in social work began in supportive and transitional housing in New York City, providing both case management and clinical services. I worked initially with adult women and eventually worked with all adults who were engaged in these services. <br>
I later transitioned to the medical setting, working in community based primary care clinics providing therapy to patients who were referred by their PCP or women’s health provider for depression, anxiety, stress, or any other mental health concern they presented with. In this setting I began working with teens and young adults and really enjoy this particular population. <br>
I immigrated from the Philippines with my family to the US when I was 10 years old. I lived in Oklahoma, then Texas, and moved to NYC in 2012. I have been living in NJ since 2018 but can provide telehealth services to New Yorkers. Other than spending time with family and friends, I enjoy reading (my favorites are fantasy or sci-fi novels), music, nature, and sports. <br>
