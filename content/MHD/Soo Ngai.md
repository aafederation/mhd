Hello, I am a psychotherapist who uses a supportive and goal-oriented approach to help steer you toward the life that you deserve. I can help you achieve your vision of a thriving and fulfilling life after identifying and clarifying your individual goals and taking committed action. While this is a process, I can help you navigate the journey by providing an empathic, supportive, and non-judgmental space. My practice focuses on building confidence, self-worth, and validation.
