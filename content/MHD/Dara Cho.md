I'm a psychoanalyst and board-certified psychiatrist practicing in Manhattan.   My areas of interest include dynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.  I am a faculty member and graduate of PANY (Psychoanalytic Association of New York) affiliated with NYU Langone Health. I am also on faculty and a Clinical Instructor at NYU School of Medicine.
