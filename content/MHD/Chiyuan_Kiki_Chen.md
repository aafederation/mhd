I am a Board-Certified Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, practicing in New York, North Carolina, and Florida, dedicated to helping individuals achieve better mental health and resilience. I completed my psychiatric nurse practitioner training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My expertise spans both outpatient and inpatient settings, working with adult clients experiencing depression, anxiety, ADHD, bipolar disorder, OCD, schizophrenia, and other mental health challenges. <br>
In my approach to client care, I prioritize warmth, support, and open-mindedness. My goal is to create a therapeutic environment where empathy and understanding take center stage, allowing you to feel truly seen and heard. I am deeply committed to honoring your values and concerns, while respecting your autonomy and choices as you navigate your journey toward personal growth and healing. <br>
You can expect sessions with me to be a collaborative space where we openly discuss your concerns and explore how mental health challenges may be impacting your life. Together, weâ€™ll develop a personalized plan tailored to your unique needs and goals. My aim is to help you feel empowered and motivated, knowing you have a compassionate partner supporting you on your journey toward improved mental health and well-being. <br>
I am also fluent, and offer sessions in, Mandarin. <br>
