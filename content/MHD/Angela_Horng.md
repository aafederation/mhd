I am a second-generational Taiwanese-American psychologist specializing in treating anxiety, depression, and interpersonal difficulties for young adults and adults through an attachment, trauma-focused lens. I prioritize treating mental health from a multicultural, multigenerational, and systemic approach. I am originally from the South Bay Area, CA, and currently reside in Brooklyn, NY. I hold dual licensure in California and New York. I would describe my style of therapy as warm, focused, and collaborative. Please feel free to reach out with any additional questions you may have!
