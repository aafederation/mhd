If you ever feel caught in a loop, as though change is just out of reach, know that you’re not alone. In this healing space, we take gentle, intentional steps toward lasting transformation. Together, we’ll tend to the layers of your experience—personal, relational, cultural, and societal—unraveling what no longer serves you. I’ll walk beside you as we imagine and move towards new possibilities, guiding you toward a life that feels more whole, more rooted, and deeply your own. <br>
I work with individuals and couples navigating the waves of anxiety, depression, vulnerability, fear, low self-esteem, emotional distress, intimacy challenges, life transitions, and the complex stressors of the past, present, and future. We will uncover locked perspectives and reveal untold chapters of your story, all while building on your strengths and embracing the many dimensions of who you are. I offer a space that is inclusive, grounding, profound, engaging, and dynamic—one that invites warmth, hope, lightness, humor, and the freedom to show up as you are, while overcoming challenges. <br>
As an Asian immigrant woman, I am passionate about supporting individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds and intersecting identities through an anti-oppressive and identity-affirming  lens. I have experience working with individuals across the lifespan experiencing difficult emotions and relationships. I draw from approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Internal Family Systems (IFS), Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), the Gottman Method, and psychoanalytic concepts related to attachment styles. <br>
My approach to therapy is a blend of exploring deeper patterns that shape your experiences, cultivating ways for you to thrive, and rewriting a story that feels more aligned with who you are—with clarity and self-compassion. <br>
I hold a M.A. in Social Work from Columbia University and a B.A. in Social Psychology from Hunter College. <br>
