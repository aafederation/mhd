I’m a Licensed Mental Health Counselor and the founder of House of Wellness Mental Health Counseling, PLLC. I’m Pakistani, and my lived experience helps me understand how culture, family expectations, and identity can shape mental health. <br>
I offer a warm, supportive space where you don’t have to explain your background. My goal is to help you feel heard, grounded, and supported as you navigate stress, transitions, and emotional challenges—at your own pace. <br>
