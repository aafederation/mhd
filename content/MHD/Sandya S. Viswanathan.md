You are the expert of your experience. What I offer is deep listening and curiosity that allows me to connect with the emotions, meanings, and beliefs beneath your words. Together, we build a relationship within which insight develops and healing takes place. I consider it a privilege to be allowed into your life and take your trust very seriously. <br>
I was trained as a trauma therapist, and I practice in a way that is holistic and expansive. I recognize that our mind-body systems hold great wisdom and resilience, as do our ancestors and intergenerational communities. Healing takes many paths, and I seek to support your inherent inclination toward health, growth, and restoration. The goal is more ease and attunement with yourself and your world. <br>
I work well with folks who crave authenticity in their relationships, as my style is actively engaged and direct. I also understand deeply that change is hard, and use warmth and humor to help ease the way. If youâ€™ve felt that therapy was too formal, or that previous therapists were too quiet, we may be a good fit! <br>
