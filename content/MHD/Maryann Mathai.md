I specialize in helping survivors of trauma find their voice and heal. My clients have had to process overwhelming experiences alone for most of their lives. My practice is centered on the belief that healing happens when your painful experiences are held with attunement and care. If you are struggling with issues related to anxiety, depression, trauma/ptsd, or major life changes, you don't have to hold it alone anymore.  I especially love working with adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. I find it an honor to witness your resilience and guide you as you reconnect with all of the parts youâ€™ve had to push away. We will use a combination of AEDP (attachment and experiential therapy), EMDR, and IFS to help you heal.
