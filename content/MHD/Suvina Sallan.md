I offer a warmly collaborative, open, and at times, gently challenging approach to help you enhance your quality of life. My clients are busy, driven adults who feel "stuck" in their relationships and careers, and disconnected from themselves and others who matter most. Many report experiencing anxiety, imposter syndrome, perfectionism, excessive worry, and burnout. Since 2013, I have compassionately guided clients toward a higher sense of fulfillment, well-being, and overall functioning. Using integrative clinical approaches tailored to your specific needs, I will partner with you to create positive change. <br>
Through our work together, you will gain personal insight, identify and change negative patterns, and use deepened self-awareness to improve your relationship with yourself and others. I enjoy working with individuals from various cultural backgrounds, with a focus on Asian/South Asian clients, including First-Generation and children of immigrants. <br>
I realize that therapist bios and profiles may seem similar and that the process of searching for a therapist can be daunting. Therefore, I prefer to make myself available for a free initial consultation, to answer any questions you may have and provide a better sense of how our work together will feel. Flexible daytime appointments available Monday-Friday. <br>
