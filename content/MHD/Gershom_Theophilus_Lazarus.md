Do you want to utilize this time to maximize your potential? An understanding of the relationship between brain functioning and behavior can help provide you insight into how you process information, and help select strategies that optimize your growth and development. I help you identify areas of concern and relate brain-behavior relationships to "every-day" strategies. I have experience supporting children, adolescents/young adults and adults with concerns including adjustment, cross-cultural, expat life, performance, depression and anxiety. I integrate various approaches with the goal of helping to guide you develop areas of strength that can buffer stress and enhance growth. I utilize psycho-education to help transform abstract concepts into an understanding of individual brain-behavior relationships. My main focus is on working with you to develop "real-world" strategies that are feasible to implement.
