I work with clients seeking growth, integration and change in how they experience their lives. <br>
When a painful event or memories influence how we interpret our lives, we can often find ourselves stuck in patterns of avoiding, numbing, overworking, obsessing, etc. Despite our best efforts to push through, we start getting signals that something is off and that a deeper issue could be the cause. These signals can present as any range of symptoms (ie anxiety, depression, irritability) or relational difficulties, that sometimes gently, and often times urgently, tell us that we need care. <br>
My work leans on the science of Neuroplasticity, Attachment Theory and the power of our Mind-Body connection. My goal is to help clients build emotional awareness, feel their difficult feelings, and rather than simply talking about struggles, change how they process and digest emotions, memories and current difficulties. <br>
My main modalities include AEDP, Lifespan Integration, Mindfulness and Brené Brown’s research on courage, shame and vulnerability. Taking that risk of opening up with authenticity can help with experiencing a more fulfilling and vibrant life. My hope is that our work together helps you find a greater sense of joy, meaning and purpose to your life story. <br>
