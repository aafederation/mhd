I am a licensed mental health counselor and I serve clients in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas. I have over 20 years of experience working in the mental health field in various treatment settings, including private practice. I graduated with a Master’s in Counseling from the University of Houston – Texas (2006). I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of St. Thomas–Houston (2003). <br>
I specialize in providing professional support and guidance for individuals who have experienced trauma such as sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, neglect, religious influence, and generational issues, as well as addressing shame, anxiety, depression, codependency, narcissistic abuse, fear of abandonment, and promoting gentle parenting techniques. <br>
