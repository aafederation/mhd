I have experience working with cancer patients and caregivers, elderly adults, women, BIPOC and LGBTQ populations in regards to chronic pain, illness, health, trauma, loss, grief, loneliness, life transitions, relationships, anxiety, depression and explorations of race, culture, sexual orientation and gender identity. I also enjoy working with first generation, immigrant and/or diaspora communities and identities and enjoy when culture, art, media and current events enter the virtual room. I also welcome your feedback and try to use and model patience, humor, authenticity, the here and now, and mindfulness based techniques in my approach. I believe you are the expert and try to help empower clients to step into their sense of agency. I also try to incorporate and learn about your culture, context and values. I am currently learning more about Neurodiversity and affirming best practices.
