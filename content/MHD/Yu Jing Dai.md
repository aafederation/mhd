I’m a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who offers virtual therapy for adults working through anxiety, depression, self-doubt, stress, and life changes. My approach is integrative and grounded in trauma-informed, culturally responsive care. I mainly draw from CBT and DBT, and also incorporate insight-oriented work and ACT-informed tools when helpful. My style is warm, steady, and collaborative—I aim to create a space where you feel safe to slow down, reflect, and explore what’s been weighing on you. As a bilingual therapist (English/Mandarin), I bring cultural humility and deep respect for the complexity of each person’s lived experience. Therapy can be a place to reconnect with your strengths, shift patterns that no longer serve you, and move toward meaningful change—at a pace that feels right for you.
