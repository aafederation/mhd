My approach to therapy is anything but one-size-fits-all. I blend a healing-centered, trauma-informed, and strength-based perspective to craft treatment plans that are as unique as you are. I am committed to meeting you exactly where you are, providing a safe, non-judgmental space where growth and transformation can flourish. Our work will focus on the changes you aspire to make while navigating and overcoming any obstacles in your path. <br>
My experience as an Asian American and transracial adoptee deeply influence my approach to therapy. This unique background provides me with valuable insights into adoption and identity issues. While these experiences enrich my understanding, my practice is both inclusive and expansive. I am dedicated to supporting individuals from all walks of life, whether you're exploring adoption, identity challenges, or facing struggles such as anxiety, depression, trauma/PTSD, or the intricacies of pregnancy and postpartum experiences. Together, we'll explore how your emotions unfold in your body, honoring the deep connection between mind and body. <br>
