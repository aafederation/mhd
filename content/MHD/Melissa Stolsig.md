In the past decade, Iâ€™ve worked with clients who are so vastly different, yet in their humanity, so alike. From narcotic treatment facilities, assisted living communities, and community mental health centers, the struggle with addiction, or a history of traumatic experiences, the common thread is human suffering and the incredible capacity for healing and growth. I truly believe that people already have everything they need to grow and heal, and the therapeutic relationship is simply the space we create where one can find their strengths. <br>
My ideal client is willing to engage in therapy to heal, grow or simply feel better. I am able to work with a variety of people from different populations due to my non-judgmental stance and curiosity about other people. I am adept at working with individuals who experience multiple problems simultaneously due to my willingness to work with other providers. I am trauma informed and culturally sensitive. <br>
I use an Existential-Humanistic perspective blended with an understanding of each individual's unique character defenses to focus on emotions in the moment. I pull from many intervention modalities to tailor an evidence based and individualized experience of human connectedness that is based in compassion. <br>
I work with clients 18 years and older individually or in groups. Special populations I treat include: LGBTQIA+, individuals experiencing racial trauma (BIPOC), men, perinatal/postnatal support, survivors of trauma, older adults (65+), active military, veterans & their adult family members. I am an EMDR Trained therapist. <br>
