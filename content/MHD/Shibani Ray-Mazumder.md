I am a clinical health psychologist working with women who are dealing with the emotional challenges of cancer as a patient or a family caregiver.  I am licensed in NY and California and see patients via computer. I understand the cultural issues around illness and caregiving that often are lost in translation and try to help my patient integrate their values and navigate the Western perspective.  I have been in private practice for over 10 years.
