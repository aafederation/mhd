I am a second-generation Asian American psychotherapist based in NYC. I work with teens and adults who struggle with anxiety, depression, grief, identify conflicts, life transitions, stress, and trauma. My approach blends person-centered and psychodynamic therapies, while also integrating other modalities that are tailored to the needs of each person. I am trained in Level 1 IFS and EMDR. I am accepting new clients.
