As a licensed psychologist, I have experiences working Asian international students, Asian Americans, and Asian immigrants. I see adults and couples in my practice. I specialize in anxiety, depression, family-child relations, and interpersonal relationship difficulties. I tailor my treatment approach to individual client needs and preferences. I believe therapy can alleviate pain but more importantly it also promotes growth and change.
