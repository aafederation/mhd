I became a therapist because I believe we all need care and connection. You might be coming to therapy because you feel stuck. You might wonder why you still struggle with anxiety, depression, or a general emptiness or unease despite “knowing better.” Often what we think of as symptoms developed to protect us in a difficult time. I enjoy working with clients to go beneath the surface—not just managing distress, but getting to the root of what’s causing pain in order to move towards an embodied sense of safety and freedom. <br>
I’m passionate about supporting clients navigating complex trauma, whether it’s intergenerational, relational or ongoing. This often intersects with other concerns like anxiety/social anxiety, depression, substance use, disordered eating, body image issues, complex family dynamics or other relationship issues. We might especially be a good fit if you’re BIPOC, an immigrant/child of immigrants, LGBTQ+, engaged in political or community work or navigating chronic illness or disability. Before becoming a therapist, I worked for many years in the tech industry. I understand the toll that these fields can take and also work with clients to process burnout, disillusionment or other work related stress. <br>
I work from a psychodynamic, somatic/experiential, relational perspective, and am committed to anti-oppressive practice. This means prioritizing trust and consent, moving at a pace that feels right for you. I believe healing is possible no matter what we’ve faced. I would be excited to be part of your journey towards a more fulfilling, meaningful life. <br>
