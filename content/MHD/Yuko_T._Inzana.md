I have been providing clinical treatment for adolescents and adults for 2 decades. I am currently licensed in NJ, NY, and PA. I have successfully treated people with depression, anxiety, trauma, family problems, and cultural and gender identity related issues and problems. Her work focuses on trauma and attachment issues, including intergenerational trauma.
