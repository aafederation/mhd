My therapeutic approach is deeply rooted in social justice principles. I recognize how systemic issues and social structures impact mental health and strive to address these issues with cultural humility and sensitivity. I believe in fostering a collaborative and authentic therapeutic relationship centered around trust, respect, and compassion. Through our therapeutic work, we will work together to navigate life's challenges, cultivate resilience, and  overcome mental hurdles by utilizing your own strengths to get you there.
