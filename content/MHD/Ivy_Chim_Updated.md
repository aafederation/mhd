Perhaps you are reading this because you feel disconnected and alone. Or you have this sense that you can’t fully be yourself. Maybe there’s a relationship that you can’t move past or it feels like there’s more grief inside you than you know what to do with. Perhaps you find yourself dancing around the pain or retreat into numbness? Maybe you are in a relationship that feels more alone than together? <br>
We all long for relationships that feel so safe that allow us to just be - with all parts of ourselves - seen, heard, accepted, and loved. We all heal in connection. A nurturing and trusting relationship provides a safe space for us to be present with our feelings and all parts of us to emerge. When our pain is held and witnessed, it starts to transform and heal. I’m here to walk alongside you. Together, we can help you slow down and learn to trust yourself. I’m here to listen with curiosity and compassion, to support you to do deep healing work and transformation. <br>
I am trained in AEDP, Imago Relationship Therapy, yoga and breathwork - all disciplines that value connection to the body, emotions, and the present moment. It is through the embodied emotional experience in the here and now that allow us to heal from the past trauma, gain experiential insights, and embrace all parts of ourselves. With my warm and attuned presence, I can help you find connection, growth, joyful aliveness for yourself or with your partner. I work with individuals and couples. Reach out for a free 30-minute consultation. I look forward to meeting with you and all parts of you! <br>
