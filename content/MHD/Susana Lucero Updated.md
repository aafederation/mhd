You are courageous for seeking therapy at this point in your life. I am a New York state licensed mental health counselor who sees each client through a multicultural lens. I believe your various identities impact the way you navigate this world. It is important to me to practice in a way that is culturally affirming and responsive. <br>
I work with individuals and couples who want to better understand and work through their depression, anxiety, relationships, self-esteem, racial/ethnic identity development, grief, family conflict, multicultural concerns, and life transitions. My clinical approach incorporates psychodynamic, existential, attachment and strength-based therapies. Together, we will work to explore your past and address present concerns to make meaningful connections and significant changes. <br>
If you think we would be a good fit, please visit my website to schedule a free consultation. I look forward to speaking with you. My practice is via telehealth and to ensure your confidentiality, I see clients located anywhere in New York state via a secure and HIPAA compliant telehealth platform. <br>
