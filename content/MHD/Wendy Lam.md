I specialize in working with adults struggling with cross-cultural dynamics & pressures and have20+ years of experience in NYC and Hong Kong. Iâ€™ve worked with an international clientele with a wide range of personalities from the anxious OCD overachiever to the ADHD self-depracating comedian. Available for online or in-person sessions with covid safety protocols. A hypoallergenic Therapy dog trainee is also available upon request.
