Therapy, as I practice it, is more than a path toward addressing challenges—it is an invitation to discover your depths and reclaim your wholeness. I see therapy as a journey of integration, harmonizing mind, body, and spirit to reveal your innate capacity for healing. Using Internal Family Systems, Motivational Interviewing, and Narrative Therapy, I help clients uncover their stories and step into self-discovery and empowerment. I have extensive experience working with trauma, identity, and justice-involved individuals. <br>
With a deep connection to the South Asian and LGBTQ+ communities, I understand the complexities of cultural expectations, identity, and belonging. My work is rooted in a culturally sensitive, trauma-informed approach, creating affirming spaces for exploration and growth. <br>
My style is warm, direct, and intuitive. I use metaphors, analogies, and creative tools to make complex concepts accessible. Whether through visualization, reframing narratives, or playful media references, I meet you where you are and help you step into where you want to be. Transformation isn’t just possible—it’s already within you, waiting to unfold. <br>
