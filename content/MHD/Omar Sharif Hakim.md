My standard rate is $175 per 50-minute individual session and $225 per 50-minute relationship counseling session (this includes couples, polycules, or other relationship constellations). Sessions involving more than two people or extended time (e.g. 75 minutes) may be billed at a higher rate, depending on the needs of the relationship.

I reserve a limited number of sliding scale spots for those who may need financial flexibility—especially queer and trans people of color, those working in nonprofit or creative fields, and others navigating economic barriers. If cost is a concern, you're welcome to reach out so we can explore what feels accessible."""

I'm a licensed therapist based in New York, grounded in care, curiosity, and connection. I work with people who are navigating identity, intimacy, anxiety, burnout, and all of life’s transitions. My approach is collaborative and affirming: I believe healing happens in spaces where all parts of you are welcome. Whether you're processing trauma, working through relationship dynamics, or just trying to feel more at home in yourself, I’m here to support you as you explore and grow into your fullest you. <br>
As a queer person of color, I understand how healing can be complicated by systems of oppression, cultural and religious expectations, and experiences of marginalization. My work is informed by a deep commitment to anti-oppressive, affirming, and liberatory care. You don’t have to overexplain your identities here. This is a space where you get to be your authentic and unfiltered self. <br>
