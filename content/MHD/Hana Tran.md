Navigating your unique life path is no simple task. Anxiety, fear, grief, and anger may overwhelm your sense of agency and fulfillment. Certain ways of coping may give temporary respite but leave you feeling stuck and disconnected. You may encounter parts of yourself that make you question who you think you are. Psychodynamic therapy is a process of self-discovery that uses insight to forge a way to lasting change, a sense of freedom, and relief from suffering. My approach is to help foster sensitivity to your singular voice as we listen attentively to the patterns and questions that emerge in the telling of your life story. <br>
I offer an individualized way of working that uses my background in art history and social work. In session, we attend to the experiences, contexts, and meanings that have shaped your inner world. We explore how you have endured conditions of power and oppression. By centering your desires, we uncover and fortify your creative capacity to transform. <br>
The way I practice is not focused on pathology or diagnoses. It is a collaborative process that uses understanding and acceptance to instill hope. Your search for a therapist affirms that you are already on the path to feeling better. The next step is to reach out and schedule time to meet. <br>
