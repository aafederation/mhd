Hi! I’m Bokyung Kim, LCSW (they/she) - a queer nonbinary poly Korean therapist. <br>
I’m an experiential, decolonizing therapist that integrates somatics, brain change science, and ancestral wisdom to help you transform your trauma & unlock true belonging with yourself and others. <br>
By coming into deeper relationship with yourself, I help you fulfill your longings for a lasting experience of belonging, connection, and self-trust. <br>
Together, we’ll address your blocks to accessing these longings and cultivate compassion and safety. This makes it possible to heal your deepest wounds and transform undesired behaviors, thought patterns, and feeling states. <br>
