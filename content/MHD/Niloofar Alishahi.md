As a licensed and board-certified Creative Arts Therapist, I believe that healing begins when weâ€™re given space to feel seen, safe, and connected; to ourselves and others. Reaching out for support is not easy, so I want to honor you for taking this first step. I specialize in working with first- and second-generation immigrants, adult children of immigrants, and sensitive, creative individuals who are navigating anxiety, depression, identity shifts, and the longing for belonging. Through art therapy, expressive techniques, and talk-based sessions grounded in relational and psychoanalytic frameworks, I help clients process difficult emotions, build inner safety, and reconnect with their voice. My approach is warm, non-judgmental, and deeply attuned. Whether words come easily to you or not, we can explore what needs attention, together. Through creativity, art, and expression, we can reconnect with and invite back those tender parts of you that were cast aside. Our safe and nonjudgmental relationship will allow you to experiment with new ways of being and harness the power of your full self.
