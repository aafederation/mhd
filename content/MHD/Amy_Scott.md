I'm a Brooklyn-based LMSW who works with individuals to support their path toward wholeness and deeper connection to their true, authentic selves. My work is motivated by the belief that exploring and attending to past wounds can allow us to meet our present experience with acceptance and move forward from a place of wholeness. <br>
My areas of focus include anxiety, life transitions, grief and loss, racial and gender identity, and complex trauma. I’m especially passionate about working with AAPI, bicultural, and BIPOC folks. <br>
I approach our work as an evolving creative collaboration that centers safety, trust, and connection. Using relational, psychodynamic, experiential, and somatic approaches within the context of trauma-informed care, I tailor our work to your needs. I’m a Level 1 AEDP therapist. I look forward to exploring how your unique experiences have shaped your hopes, needs, and goals. <br>
