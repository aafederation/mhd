I'm a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) in New York City. I hold a Master’s Degree in Mental Health Counseling and Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology, both from Baruch College. Additionally, I have been trained in Couples Counseling with The Gottman Institute. I utilize ACT, EFT, and psychodynamic interventions while working with individuals and couples struggling with cultural identity challenges, interpersonal relationship distress, life transitions, anxiety, and depression. I also provide maternal mental healthcare to mothers at any stage of their motherhood journey.
