My approach to psychotherapy is based on psychodynamic therapy, but my work is also influenced by existential therapy, strength-based therapy, mindfulness, and spirituality, which I have come to deeply appreciate through my experience of working with complex cultural issues, trauma, grief and loss, end-of-life issues, death and dying, and serious medical conditions, as well as depression, anxiety, and severe mental illness.  I also conduct psychotherapy in English and Japanese.
