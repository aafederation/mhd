I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor in New York, with four years of experience. I work with individuals and couples to navigate career development, relational issues, depression, anxiety, attention deficit, stress, trauma and challenges with body image. I am an Indian, immigrant, bisexual, neurodivergent woman. I especially enjoy working with international students and people of color, helping them navigate the ineffective systems and barriers they face while creating connection and excellence in their lives. I completed my MA and MEd in Counseling Psychology from Columbia University. <br>
My main goal is to empower you to reconnect with your true self, understand your emotions, and find your own path toward healing. We'll explore your feelings and experiences in a safe, non-judgmental way, helping you build curiosity, compassion, and the confidence to navigate challenges and create better relationships. <br>
My approach combines different techniques, like AEDP (which focuses on emotional growth and transformation), Internal Family Systems (IFS), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Narrative Therapy, and Art Therapy. I bring in a mix of learning, creativity, and practical tools to help you make lasting changes. <br>
