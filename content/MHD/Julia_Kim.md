As an Asian-American woman, I believe our cultural experiences make us uniquely special. I value understanding you from your shoes, no matter your background or reason for therapy. My goal is to work with you, to empower you, and to provide you the insight/tools to live the life you want. <br>
I specialize in anxiety, depression, self-esteem and relationship concerns, new and old trauma, life stressors, existential struggles and medical, surgical and pain conditions. I work with individuals going through difficult times, as well as those who are seeking personal growth and purpose. <br>
I received my doctorate in psychology from Long Island University and have been a licensed clinical psychologist since 2006. I am licensed in the states of New York and Illinois. I started my journey with a deep interest in psychoanalysis and a passion to help others. My diverse experience has taught me the art of helping others holistically and embracing the complexity that makes each of us unique. <br>
