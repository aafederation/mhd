Jem’s therapeutic focus is on improving the quality of relationships in one's life. Relationships involve your experience with yourself and others and may include food, sex, your body, work, money, and drugs and alcohol. By getting curious about real-time thoughts, Jem then helps you recognize patterns and larger stories that you carry about yourself and relationships. This allows for more conscious choices, with the purpose building new or upon existing skills for the expression of a client’s true potential. <br>
Jem approaches partners with an understanding that people vary in their need for intimacy and closeness and that these differences can create conflict. She aims to help couples interact with an increasingly well-developed understanding of each others’ inner workings, helping transform conflict into opportunities for deeper intimacy and connection with a holistic, trauma informed lens. <br>
Jem is known for working in a collaborative, warm, humorous, yet direct way as she supports clients through the courageous process of seeking fulfilling relationships. Her experience in growing up in between cultures, working as a CPA in the fast-paced world of investing, teaching yoga and meditation and publishing academic research are also integrated into her work. Currently, she is in the process of becoming a somatic intimacy and relationship coach, further deepening her work around intimacy, embodiment, self-expression, and relational healing. <br>
