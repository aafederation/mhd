Weishin Huang, LMSW, MDiv (he/they) is a Licensed Master Social Worker who works with adults, and whose approach is grounded in somatic awareness, mindfulness, and trauma-informed care. He brings a warm, open-hearted presence to the therapy space, honoring the psychological insight and embodied wisdom that naturally unfold in your healing journey. <br>
As a Chinese-American immigrant and longtime Zen Buddhist practitioner, Weishin is especially attuned to the complexities of selfhood, trauma, and systemic oppression. They bring curiosity, kindness, and compassion to your full personhood, recognizing how identity, cultural background, family dynamics, intergenerational history, spirituality, and societal structures all shape our lived experience. He believes the path to wholeness is a relational and communal process - woven from the personal and political, the past and present, the individual and collective. <br>
Weishin holds a Master of Social Work from Columbia University and a Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary. He is lay-ordained in the Soto Zen lineage of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. With a background in theater and dance in New York City, they also welcome your creativity and imagination to nurture your growth and transformation. <br>
