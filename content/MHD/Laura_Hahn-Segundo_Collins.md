I am a 1st-gen Korean-Filipinx American and child of immigrants. I am a "forever athlete," understanding of that unique athlete mentality through 15 years in elite gymnastics and Division I diving. I am a partner, parent, and childbirth educator, understanding of the changing dynamics in family evolution. I am a psychotherapist with 20+ years practicing, educating, and supervising mental health in public, nonprofit, and private sectors. My life experiences combined with my training in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, childbirth education, and leadership have shaped my practice. I offer care integrating attachment, object relations, and ego psychology with trauma-informed care, narrative therapy, cognitive reframing, and practical tools. And particularly for athletes and coaches, whole-person care, focus, and internal regulation for sports performance.
