Maria was born in Bangladesh and adopted to Rochester, New York. She has been featured in the New York Times and has given a Tedx Talk on Nonviolent Communication. She places a high value on understanding patientsâ€™ needs and building connection through her extensive background in communication skills. Her life experiences align with her desire to help others unlock their individual healing potential with a particular interest in pain management, anxiety, stress, and women's health. <br>
Maria thoroughly enjoys building relationships and helping people. As a child, she wanted to become a doctor. However, Maria saw that her own doctor had less time spent with patients and more time spent behind a screen. Still having a deep emphasis on helping others, Maria chose to jump into the nonprofit world for several years. At age 25, she completed a month long solo trip across Spain (El Camino de Santiago) to figure out how to align her values of helping others, life-long learning, & cultivating self awareness into a meaningful career path. This led her back to acupuncture. <br>
