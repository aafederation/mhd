Matthew graduated from New York University’s Silver School of Social Work and has been practicing therapy since 2022. He has been trained in clinical work with children and teenagers. In addition, he sees adults of all ages and helps them navigate a myriad of social, emotional, physical challenges. As a queer Chinese-American, Matthew’s diverse background and experiences have contributed to a practice in which he can comfortably encourage others to embrace all facets of their identity. Matthew is currently a clinician working with KLS Collective.
