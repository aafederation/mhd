Many of my clients describe life as feeling heavier than it should. They’re checking all the boxes—a good job, stable relationships, family approval, but they feel disconnected from their lives. Some find themselves impatient with people they care about. Activities that once brought joy now feel like obligations. They may wonder: Is this just how adulthood feels? Am I being dramatic? For those who are Asian or Asian American, there’s often added invisible weight:a sense of not fully belonging anywhere, guilt about wanting something different from what their parents envisioned, and exhaustion from always needing to prove their worth. <br>
They want a therapist who understands the weight they’re carrying and the cultural layers that shape their story. They’re ready to shed the mental burdens they are carrying and find ease, confidence and joy. Together, we explore what's beneath the surface and reconnect with the parts of themselves that have been quietly waiting. <br>
Before becoming a therapist, I worked as a product marketing manager at Google. I know what it's like to have the "right" job and still feel something's missing. Clients have told me that therapy helped them feel lighter and more present for their lives. If any of the above resonates, learn more by visiting my website or booking a consultation. <br>
