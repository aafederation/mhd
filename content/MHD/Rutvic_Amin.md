As a successful physician with a career spanning more than 20 years.  I have experience in a variety of medical settings, including primary care, emergency medicine and inpatient care.  My personal experiences have given me the insight to provide wellness and preventative mental health services. A “type A” medical professional, I understand how the stress of a demanding career impacts one’s health. As a cardiac patient who underwent two major open heart surgeries before the age of 45, I have endured the physically and mentally taxing patient experience and understand its ongoing lasting effects. A father of three young kids and a son of aging parents, I know how one’s own self care can easily fall to the wayside when managing busy work and family life. <br>
When you take the time to prioritize your mental health you will find you have more time for everyone else in your life. I specialize in supporting busy professionals who struggle with the pressures of perfectionism, high stress, burnout, negative self talk, addiction, and imposter syndrome. I understand the quiet shame and stigma that often come with seeking help, and how this can lead to isolation, inadequacy, fear, depression, and anxiety. I am here to help! Mental health takes work just as getting physically fit does. <br>
I offer a compassionate and individualized approach, respecting your values and boundaries. I will help you gain insight into your behavioral and thinking patterns: often the result of major life events. We will then work together to find effective tools to overcome the obstacles which stand in the way of your confidence, happiness and peace. <br>
