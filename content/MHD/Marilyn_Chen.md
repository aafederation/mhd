Therapy isn’t just about managing symptoms. It’s about personal growth and finding a more fulfilling path in life. My style is warm and inviting. I customize my approach to fit a patient's unique needs, drawing from various therapeutic frameworks to provide the most effective support. My intake process involves gathering detailed history, assessing symptoms, understanding the areas in which you struggle, and your goals for therapy. A patient's progress is a priority, and progress can take time; I aim to create a space where my patients feel safe and truly understood throughout our journey together. I am especially enjoying working with my growing base of patients of Asian and Asian-American descent.
