안녕하세요! Hi, I'm Julia! I'm an Asian American therapist based in NYC! I hold years of experience successfully working with teens, adults, and young professionals who are struggling with relational issues (codependency & turbulent relational patterns), ADHD, understanding transgenerational trauma, family dynamics, cultural identity, depression, and anxiety. I utilize creative, holistic evidence-based psychotherapy to help people feel more whole, resilient and joyful. Working with me will be a creative collaboration with a goal of helping you heal and live in a way aligned with your needs, wants, and life goals. :-)
