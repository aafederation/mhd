After completing her graduate studies at Columbia University in 2013, Connie started her private practice in psychiatry to help people manifest their personal and professional goals.  She uses schema therapy, coaching, lifestyle changes, and medications, if needed, to guide people in making decisions that support their values and life goals.  In her practice, she specializes in using psychological, social, and educational assessments to help tailor therapy to a person's strengths and personality.  In her previous career, she was a special education teacher who worked with emotionally troubled adolescents, so uses that skillset to teach reparenting skills to adults who want to avoid repeating intergenerational trauma by caring for their inner children.\ <br>
Connie appreciates the complexity of the intersection of class, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, and sexuality in a personâ€™s life.  With that said, she especially connects with adult children of immigrants, people of color, and the LGBTQIA+ community. <br>
