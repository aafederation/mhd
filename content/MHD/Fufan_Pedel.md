I specialize in helping clients with trauma, whether it manifests as PTSD, panic attacks, depression, or addiction. My approach is client-centered and trauma-informed, drawing from modalities like DBT, IFS, EMDR, and CBT-based skills. Progress often includes developing coping skills, experiencing a sense of calm and presence, and building meaningful connections with yourself and others. To support your growth outside of sessions, I often suggest practical exercises to help you feel more empowered. My ultimate goal is to help you build a greater sense of hope and resilience in your life.
