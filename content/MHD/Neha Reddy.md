I work with individuals and groups to transform self-understanding into happier, more productive living. My practice is dedicated to helping clients navigate and heal from chronic stress, anxiety, depression, relationship conflict, complex trauma, and significant life transitions. <br>
My unique offering combines the depth of psychotherapy to uncover underlying emotional and behavioral patterns with the strategic focus of coaching to accelerate goal achievement. This dual approach helps you identify the barriers that prevent success and develop practical, sustainable strategies to overcome them. <br>
My therapeutic lens is rooted in the mind-body connection, utilizing creative and somatic modalities to increase self-attunement and enhance mental agility, which are critical elements for true healing. Through a highly collaborative process, we will clarify your goals and define a personalized path forward, fostering a sense of control and empowerment every step of the way. <br>
With over 15 years of experience in diverse clinical settings, I bring a wealth of expertise to my practice. I am a Licensed Creative Arts Therapist, Somatic Experiencing Practitioner, Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapist and Emotional Intelligence Coach. <br>
My background spans from working in psychiatric hospital settings to guiding high-functioning clients in private practice. I am committed to advancing professional education, having presented at leading universities like Columbia University, NYU, and Brooklyn College, and conducting specialized trauma and wellness workshops for professionals. <br>
