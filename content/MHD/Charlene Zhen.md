I’m a psychodynamic therapist based in New York City working with adults and couples who appear capable and successful on the outside but feel anxious, burnt out, or disconnected inside. Many of my clients are Asian American and adult children of immigrants navigating family and cultural expectations and questions of identity and direction. After years of meeting expectations, you may feel unsure what you actually want or who you are outside of your roles. <br>
My approach is psychodynamic, culturally informed, and reflective. We explore how family dynamics, cultural context, and early experiences shape your present emotions, relationships, and choices. Rather than focusing only on symptoms, we look at recurring patterns and internal pressures so you can develop deeper self understanding and greater clarity. I also work with couples, including interracial and cross cultural couples, to understand how family of origin and intergenerational patterns influence their relationship and communication. Before becoming a therapist, I spent nearly a decade in tech startups, which informs how I understand burnout, perfectionism, and performance pressure in high achieving environments. <br>
