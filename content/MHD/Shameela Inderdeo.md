My approach as a therapist is predominantly from a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy perspective. This allows me to help my clients identify their thoughts and behaviors around their relationships, triggers, family dynamics and childhood issues/trauma. Using both eclectic and humanistic approach to accentuates the significance of being your true self in order to be the most fulfilling and best version of yourself.
