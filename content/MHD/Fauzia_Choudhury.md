As a first-generation Indian-American with a touch of Bengali culture, I understand firsthand the complexities and nuances of navigating multiple cultural identities. I specialize in working with individuals and couples from diverse cultural backgrounds and take a holistic and personalized approach to therapy. I offer a compassionate and empathetic space for you to navigate life's complexities, cultivate resilience, and foster a greater sense of well-being within yourself and your community.

If you're seeking a therapist who understands the intersection of culture and mental health and is dedicated to supporting you on your path to healing and self-discovery, I'm here to help. Whether you're grappling with identity issues, navigating relationship dynamics, or confronting intergenerational tensions, my therapy space is one of safety and acceptance, where your thoughts and emotions are met with understanding and support.
