Cici (Yinxi) (she/her) is a bilingual therapist, fluent in both English and Mandarin Chinese. She holds a Master’s degree in Social Work from the University of Chicago, with specialized training in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), as well as trauma-informed approaches. Since 2016, Cici has been offering mental health support across various global settings. Clients and colleagues often describe her as compassionate, approachable, and someone they can truly trust and connect with. <br>
Cici deeply values each person’s unique journey and believes in the healing power of mindful, heart-centered listening. Her therapeutic approach is warm, nurturing, and focused on creating a safe space where people can feel grounded and supported. <br>
In recent years, Cici’s work has primarily been in hospital settings and higher levels of care (Intensive Outpatient Programs & Partial Hospitalization Programs). Cici has been helping clients navigate depression, anxiety, relationship challenges, grief/loss, life transitions, past and current trauma, and chronic illness/pain. She has experience working with individuals, couples, and groups, with a focus on supporting adult clients. <br>
Before becoming a therapist, Cici studied art and film philosophy, earning degrees from the University of Cambridge and New York University. While she no longer works directly in the arts, she continues to believe in the importance of creativity, self-expression, and emotional depth as key parts of the human experience. She is also pursuing training in art therapy to integrate her background in the arts into her current mental health practice. <br>
Outside of work, Cici finds joy in journaling, taking long walks in the city, watching sunsets, and capturing life’s beautiful moments through photography. <br>
