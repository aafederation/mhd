My style as a psychotherapist is engaging, warm, and reflective, and I place a great emphasis on building trust and connection as the foundation of my clinical work. From there, we can begin to explore difficult and sometimes painful life experiences and understand the emotions beneath it. By paying attention to these experiences and emotional signals, you can better understand yourself, both past and present. I believe, at birth, we are all hard wired for healing and self-repair but we need the support of trusting and caring relationships to access the powerful drive within ourselves to heal, grow, love, and flourish. <br>
I have been in clinical practice for 25 years, and I work with clients from a wide range of backgrounds and age groups. In addition to clinical work, I am an assistant professor at Fairfield University. My psychotherapy practice is grounded in post-modern and psychodynamic theories and I apply trauma-informed lens, AEDP and cognitive behavioral therapies. <br>
My style is engaging, warm, and reflective. Whether this is your first time seeking therapy or you have been in therapy before, it can feel a bit scary or intimating to reach out. I welcome talking with you by phone to help you understand my clinical approach to healing process and how we might work together, so you can make this important decision. <br>
