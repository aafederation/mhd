My name is Ame (pronounced Amy) and I provide a non-judgmental, supportive yet gentle and direct approach. As an LCSW with over 10 years of experience, I am trained in gestalt therapy, with a focus on somatic experiencing. Gestalt is a humanistic, integrative and person-centered form of psychotherapy focusing on the present moment and restoring the individual to their whole self. Somatics in simple terms is the meaning of sensations that arise in your body when experiencing an emotion or event.  I specialize in working with bi-poc, Asian Americans, and second-generation individuals. My focus areas include anxiety, depression, mood disorders, life transitions, career, identity, intergenerational trauma, and cultural issues.
