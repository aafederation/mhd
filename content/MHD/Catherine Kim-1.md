Are you tired of battling anxiety and constant overthinking alone? Do you feel like you don't belong anywhere? As an experienced Asian female therapist, I offer compassionate and thorough guidance to help you navigate cultural conflicts, identity issues, trauma, self-esteem, and relationship challenges. As someone who grew up between two distinct cultures, I deeply understand the challenges that cultural differences can bring. My passion is helping clients break free from old patterns and discover their true selves, leading to a more fulfilling and happier life.  
My therapy style is supportive, empowering, and empathic. With my specialty in treating depression and anxiety, I have extensive experience working with marginalized communities such as AAPI populations. I tailor my care plans to meet your needs and cultural background, ensuring you receive the most personalized and culturally sensitive treatment.
