The upheaval of the past two years has led to an awakening regarding the importance of nurturing our mental health. Many people are facing increased fear, anxiety, depression, isolation, and uncertainty in light of todayâ€™s life challenges and changes. Some are recognizing a feeling of loss and grief that transcends the traditional definition. Others are struggling to be seen, heard, and affirmed. These experiences can be related to relationships, family, work/career, school, racial trauma, or physical health/safety.

In my practice, I value a therapeutic alliance rooted in authenticity and trust. I offer a warm, accepting space to explore your authentic self, set personalized goals, and develop new skills to achieve growth and healing. My approach is humanistic and person-centered, inclusive of individual strengths to foster self-compassion and personal agency. I have specialized training in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and meaning-centered therapy, in addition to over 15 years of experience helping individuals and families cope with serious illness.

Please feel free to reach out to me by email or phone. I look forward to connecting and seeing if we are a good fit.
