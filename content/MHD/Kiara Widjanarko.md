Coming from a Southeast Asian background where mental health is stigmatized, I understand that coming to therapy can be intimidating. I aim to create a safe, non-judgmental space where your experiences and feelings are seen and heard, and where we build on your existing strengths. To achieve this, I draw from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, and Mindfulness. <br>
I have worked with college students facing academic stress, relationship issues, low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. I have also supported adults with substance use disorders in managing triggers, pursuing goals, practicing mindfulness, and understanding the link between mental health and addiction. Prior to my experience as a therapist, I worked in research with young children, veterans with PTSD, and adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease. <br>
