I am a licensed psychologist who provides psychotherapy for adolescents and adults. Trained in multiple therapeutic models I adopt an integrative approach as it is flexible to patientsâ€™ needs and conducive to building a the therapeutic alliance. I possess over a decade of experience practicing in a broad range of clinical settings with individuals of diverse backgrounds.  My style is nonjudgmental, empathic, and interactive, and I strive to develop strong collaborative therapeutic relationships with my clients. <br>
In addition to my clinical work, I am on the faculty of the Counseling Psychology Program at Boston University. I completed the PhD in the APA Accredited program in School and Child Psychology at New York University and post-graduate training in psychotherapy at The Washington Square Institute. <br>
