I was trained at UC Berkeley, CU Boulder, Yale University and Columbia University. I then remained at Columbia University as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons before returning to the San Francisco Bay Area. I served on the faculty at Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, for 15 years, beginning as a Consultant Assistant Professor and later as a Clinical Associate Professor (Affiliated). During my time at Stanford, I was also a researcher and faculty member at the National Center for PTSD at the Palo Alto VA, where I conducted research on trauma and PTSD. <br>
I am currently a Distinguished Professor of Clinical Psychology at the Ph.D. Clinical Psychology program at the California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) at the Alliant International University in the San Francisco Bay Area, an APA-accredited program. I am a licensed Clinical Psychologist in California and New York and hold Fellow status in the Clinical Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association, an honor bestowed upon about 5% of APA members in recognition of outstanding contributions to psychology at the national or international level. <br>
