I am a queer, Korean American adoptee therapist and my areas of practice are often informed by my own identities and experiences. My approach is integrative and empathetic, and influenced by a variety of therapeutic interventions and trauma-informed practice. I especially welcome LGBTQIA+ folks, adoptees, college & graduate students, and those who are family building and experiencing infertility. I work with adult individuals only at this time, providing online video sessions. I am truly humbled by the opportunity to work alongside you and I look forward to hearing from you.
