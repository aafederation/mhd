Saphia Shaffie is a Board-Certified Licensed Clinical Social Worker who offers thoughtful, intentional therapy grounded in both clinical expertise and genuine human connection. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Psychology from SUNY Albany and completed her Master’s degree in Clinical Social Work at CUNY Hunter College. <br>
My practice focuses on supporting individuals through complex experiences that may feel overwhelming, from everyday stressors to the impact of intergenerational trauma. Even in moments of uncertainty, you deserve the space to feel, process, and heal. You don’t have to navigate it alone. In therapy, we’ll work together to help you feel more grounded, confident, and supported through whatever season of life you’re in. Our work is collaborative and tailored to you, focusing on practical coping strategies that genuinely fit your life, strengthening communication, and gaining clarity around what matters most to you. <br>
