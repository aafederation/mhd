I’m a bilingual Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) based in New York with a Master’s in Social Work from Columbia University. As someone with a bicultural background, I provide therapy in both English and Mandarin, supporting clients as they navigate challenges including anxiety, depression, trauma, life transitions, and cultural adjustment. I’ve worked with children, teens, and adults from diverse backgrounds, helping them cultivate balance, inner strength, and self-compassion in their daily lives. My earlier work in community mental health focused on guiding individuals and families to strengthen emotional regulation, improve relationships, and build coping skills. <br>
I bring a deep understanding of how early experiences can shape our emotions and relationships, and I approach this work with warmth, authenticity, and deep respect for each client’s story. My goal is to create a space where you feel genuinely understood and supported as you explore new ways of healing and growth. <br>
