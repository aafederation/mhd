I believe healing is within everyone.

With a former career in geography and cartography, unveiling the interconnectedness of people, environment, time & space is part of my life. Maps tell us where we are, and offer a perspective and direction that inform where we want to go. Yet, sometimes we lose sight of our own roadmap in life, lose connection to self, and get stuck in the pain and suffering.

I believe therapy is a creative and dynamic mapping process. We will work together with compassion and curiosity to explore your inner world and navigate emotional terrains. Whether you feel lost in life transition, overwhelmed with anxiety and depression, or stuck in place by trauma, together we can help you reconnect with your inner compass and find a path forward. I am committed to hold space for you to feel and express, be seen and heard, and to support you to heal and grow.

I hold a Master’s degree in Social Work from Fordham University. I am trained as a yoga teacher and breathwork facilitator. I take a heart-centered, mind-body approach to psychotherapy while considering everyone’s individual needs and goals. I integrate therapeutic modalities including CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy), AEDP (Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy), Internal Family Systems (IFS), and mindfulness practices. I specialize in the treatment of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, sexual abuse, and intergenerational trauma.
