Welcome to Shifa Therapy LLC, a space for healing. Serving NJ, NY, and PA, my practice centers the Global Majority, especially BIPOC folks within the LGBTQIA+ community. As a queer therapist of color, Desi Muslim, and trauma specialist, my goal is for you to be seen and understood as you are. No code-switching necessary. <br>
I offer a relational approach that integrates Somatic Experiencing, IFS, EMDR, Liberation Psychology, and the systemic, cultural, and sociopolitical realities of life. Throughout our work, I will invite you with patience and compassion, going at your pace as you build new adaptations toward thriving. Think of this as a more immersive and experiential kind of process that goes beyond insight and coping skills. <br>
Feel free to reach out if this speaks to you or if you have any questions about getting started. I look forward to meeting you. <br>
