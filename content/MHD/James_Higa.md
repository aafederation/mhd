I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in Sierra Madre, CA, specializing in trauma and PTSD. I provide in-person services, as well as telehealth services, to residents of California and New York. I have worked extensively with adult and adolescent survivors of childhood sexual abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, and relational trauma for 13 years. I started my career as a therapist with the Crime Victims Treatment Center in New York City, where I ran a group for male survivors of childhood sexual abuse. I received my Master's in Social Work and Master's in Public Health from Columbia University. <br>
I have training in Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP), Internal Family Systems (IFS), and am a Certified Clinical Trauma Professional (CCTP-II). My approach is rooted in the belief that safety and connection between client and therapist are the foundation for healing. <br>
My main goals for therapy include reducing the shame, overwhelming fear, and isolation that many trauma survivors experience. As a therapist, I serve as a supportive, caring, and attentive guide in revisiting emotional wounds. In working as a team to have new and positive emotional experiences, we can achieve vitality, connection, authenticity, and transformation. <br>
