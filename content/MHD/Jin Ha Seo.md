Hi I'm Jin Ha! I am a Mental Health Counselor with extensive training and expertise in assisting Children, Adolescents, and Adults grappling with anxiety, depression, racial/ ethnic identity and self esteem. I utilize mostly narrative therapy and relational therapy frameworks, as I firmly believe that you are the expert of your own unique story. <br>
Being a Korean immigrant and a local New Yorker, I'm fluent in both English and Korean. We can hold sessions fully in Korean if needed. My bicultural identity also allows me to approach counseling with a culturally sensitive lens. I aim to guide you to dive deeper into all your life experiences, to regain hope for a more fulfilling life. <br>
Sometimes asking for help can be hard and this may be your first big step into your healing journey. I aim to listen to your story and empower you through evidence-based practices, but most importantly, by building a strong therapeutic relationship together. You may have hurt in silence, but don't heal in silence. I look forward to meeting you soon! <br>
