I am a board certified psychiatric nurse practitioner treating children, adolescents, and adults. I am experienced in treating mood disorders, depression, panic disorder, anxiety, OCD, ADHD, and sleep disorders. My approach varies, depending on your needs and concerns. Beyond medication management, I often look to the following therapy modalities: internal family systems, dialectical behavioral therapy, existential psychotherapy, and motivational interviewing. I believe these approaches offer the broadest and most practical applications in managing one's mental health.
