I'm a clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology. I take a non-judgmental, compassionate, and collaborative approach to help people understand themselves better and improve their relationships with others. I also aim to help people move toward the life goals values that feel most meaningful to them. My style is integrative, and I draw largely from cognitive-behavioral, acceptance-based, and solution-focused approaches. I'm also very aware of how different aspects of a person's identity—like race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality—can affect their health and well-being. <br>
I specialize in helping both adolescents and adults with depression, anxiety, and other emotional challenges. I also focus on supporting parents and caregivers with their mental health during pregnancy and after the baby is born. I also have a lot of experience helping with children's emotional and behavioral challenges. However, because of the limits of telehealth, I’m currently only taking cases where I can mainly work with parents and caregivers to address these issues. <br>
