I am a tri-lingual (English/Mandarin/Cantonese) psychotherapist with over 10 years of experience supporting individuals, couples, and families as they navigate challenging transitions in life. As a queer-identified therapist, I am particularly passionate about providing affirming care to LGBTQIA+ clients and have extensive training in this area. I also work closely with immigrants and children of immigrant parents, addressing issues related to acculturation, immigration trauma, and intergenerational conflict. I appreciate the complexity of human experience and strive to create a safe environment for clients to fully express their life stories.
