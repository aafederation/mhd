I am a culturally and trauma informed therapist in NY. I intend to create an atmosphere where you feel connected, heard, validated, and safe. I hold that each person is an expert of their own lives and fosters a safe, inclusive, and non-judgement space where you are able to express your thoughts/feelings/emotions freely. My belief is that healing is a process that looks different for each person. I am here to journey with you through every step. I treat issues related to depression, anxiety, trauma, sexual identity, adjustments/life transitions, men’s mental health, imposter syndrome, self-esteem and work/immigration/racial stress. I also consult mental health evaluations for some immigration cases. <br>
I integrate CBT, mindfulness, DBT, TF-CBT, Interpersonal and Cognitive Processing therapy. I tailor sessions to meet each client’s individual needs while also incorporating their cultural and spiritual perspectives in the treatment plans that we create together. I am also LIFT (LGBTQ+ Institute for Family Therapy) certified. <br>
