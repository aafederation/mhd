I obtained my doctorate from Long Island University. My passion for the work comes from witnessing the growth of others as well as being on the path of self-discovery. Being a part of clientsâ€™ lives in private practice, at Bellevue Hospital, Nassau University Medical Center, New York University, and Cambridge Hospital/Harvard Medical School has honed my ability to listen to, share and stay connected with the pain and joy of being human. <br>
My personal journey and over 15 years experience has helped me to cultivate the compassion, curiosity and desire involved with accompanying others in their struggle to make meaningful changes in their lives. Fitting in, what am I doing in with my life, identity, work, and relationship issues, asian and dealing with changes in health are some of the things I work with.  Helping people figure out if they are Asian or American (enough) or both/neither is a specialty of mine.\ <br>
