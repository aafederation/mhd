Hi, I'm Jenn! I'm a telehealth psychotherapist, practicing in NY and FL. I provide culturally informed care for individuals navigating negative self-talk, low self-esteem, and a desire to live authentically. As the daughter of Chinese immigrant parents, I relate to the challenges of balancing multiple cultural expectations and identities, especially when they seem to pull you in different directions. This internal conflict can often leave us feeling lost, overwhelmed, or uncertain about who we genuinely are. It can also lead to guilt, shame, and self-doubt, as we try to reconcile what is "right", what is "wrong", and who we "should" be. <br>
My approach is rooted in Psychodynamic/Psychoanalytical Therapy with the integration of Narrative, IFS, and EMDR. I specialize in exploring internal conflicts and building greater awareness of clients' true selves. It's a collaborative process, where we'll explore unconscious needs, unresolved issues, and defense mechanisms that hinder internal peace. <br>
I commit to fostering self-compassion and embracing who you are to the core. When you acknowledge your limitations with kindness, you can move toward true self-love and acceptance. Together, we will explore your past experiences, cultural background, and the varying parts within you to find clarity and establish a secure sense of self. <br>
