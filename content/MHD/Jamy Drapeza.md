Hi, I'm Jamy! I am a queer therapist of color, continuing a matrilineal tradition of four generations serving communities as healers and caregivers. This family value led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Social Work, and I now combine my love of service and healthy living to support my clients in healing for healthier futures.
