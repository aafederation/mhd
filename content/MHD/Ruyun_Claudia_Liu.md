Life is hard, and you are taking the courageous first step to seek help from counseling. It is my honor to accompany you through this therapy journey. As your therapist, I bring my authentic and compassionate self into the room to provide a safe, nonjudgmental, and warm space for you to freely express yourself and engage in self-exploration. Utilizing strength-based approaches, I work with you to discover your inner strength and resilience that will help you move forward in your life. No matter what brings you to therapy, you will be heard, and your needs will be at the center of our work. <br>
Promoting healing and helping people to achieve their fullest potential is my passion. I earned my B.A. in Psychology at the New York University and continued my education at Teachers College, Columbia University, where I obtained my Ed.M. and M.A. in Mental Health Counseling. <br>
During sessions, I conduct counseling work with clients at their own pace to explore how to manage their immediate concerns and improve overall well-being in the long term. Respecting my clients' readiness and autonomy, I work collaboratively with clients to explore effective coping strategies, identify connections between past and present, and other topics that promote personal growth. I have been trained in person-centered therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), psychodynamic therapy, Motivational Interviewing (MI), Brief Therapy (BT), mindfulness, and multicultural counseling. I also utilized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Insomnia (CBT-I) and Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) to treat specific concerns. I believe that therapy is not a one size fits all, so I use an integrative approach and tailor therapy to match the needs of each of my clients. <br>
I am bilingual in English and Mandarin and provide culturally sensitive therapy to clients with diverse racial and cultural backgrounds. As someone who has lived, studied, and worked in China and the United States, I believe our identity, relationship, family, and culture impact our everyday experience and self-perception. I am here to listen to your story, guide your exploration, and help you achieve your goals. <br>
