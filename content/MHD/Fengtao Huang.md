Hello, it's great to meet you! Are you feeling overwhelmed or anxious about transitioning to parenthood? Do you have chronic stress, sadness, anger, or fear related to parenting and relationship challenges? Is your child having social, behavioral, and emotional difficulties? Being a parent can be the most amazing yet challenging experience. I am here to support you through the process. I recognize clients are the experts that they are, and I hope to make you feel heard, supported, and empowered during our collaborations. <br>
I specialize in maternal mental health with a focus on prenatal and postpartum mood disorders, immigration/generational trauma, parent-child bonding, and parenting skills building. My therapeutic approach combines psychodynamic, attachment, play therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. <br>
