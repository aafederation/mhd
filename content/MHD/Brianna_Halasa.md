I intertwine my experiences as a psychotherapist, yoga teacher, perpetual student, community organizer, identity as an Arab American, and insights from my own mental health journey into my holistic practice. I aim to provide an engaging and warm environment where together we can access tools to help you cope with stressors; set healthy boundaries and improve communication to fuel connection and build relationships; step into your emotions to better regulate them; reprocess past traumatic experiences; and strengthen your attunement and awareness to your body. You have the innate power to heal yourself, Iâ€™m simply here to guide and empower you along the way.
