I see the therapeutic process as a way to learn skills that allow you to be psychologically present while handling painful thoughts and emotions in an effective way. I focus on increasing psychological flexibility to overcome preoccupation with past or future, and promoting behaviors that contact psychological experiences in a non-defensive way. Using a mindfulness-based approach, I encourage clients to look at their thoughts and not from their thoughts to resolve cognitive fusion. I also emphasize receptiveness and openness to uncomfortable experiences to address experiential avoidance.

I focus on individual experiences in their sociocultural contexts and help make sense of the connection between one’s experiences, beliefs and behaviors. Currently I’m providing virtual services only.
