As an Asian American Productivity & ADHD Coach, I specialize in helping individuals, including those who may be undiagnosed, navigate the unique challenges of ADHD while honoring their cultural backgrounds. Drawing from my personal experience and extensive self-education in culturally competent treatment models, I offer empathetic and tailored support to enhance productivity and well-being. My approach combines practical strategies with a deep understanding of the cultural nuances that influence mental health, empowering clients to achieve their goals with confidence and clarity.
