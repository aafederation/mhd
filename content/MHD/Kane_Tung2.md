Dr. Kane Tung works to be the therapist he would want for himself, creating a safe space not just so you can open and honest with the therapist, but so you can be open and honest with yourself, which would be the first step. He has extensive personal and professional experience managing and bringing fulfillment to individuals and caregivers of Developmental Disabilities. Kane’s style was also profoundly shaped by his years of work with Older Adults at Long Island Jewish Hospital and nursing homes as he specialized in Grief and End of Life cases bringing all events of a client’s life together to make sense of it honestly and genuinely. <br>
Kane is excited to be marrying his clinical practice and wide spectrum of experiences from being a Producer at SyFy Channel and SONY, as well as a newspaper journalist and playwright to his considerable work with the early Anime and Gaming community. <br>
