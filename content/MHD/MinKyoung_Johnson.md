I offer a free 30-minute consultation so you can get to know me and feel confident before beginning ongoing sessions. Hi, I’m Min Kyoung. If you’re feeling weighed down by anxiety, depression, grief, trauma, or relationship struggles, you don’t have to carry it alone. I provide a warm and compassionate space where my clients can share openly and begin their healing journey. Together, we’ll uncover what’s holding you back and create meaningful steps to restore balance, resilience, and hope. Drawing from CBT, DBT, mindfulness, and trauma-informed care, I help clients process pain and build healthier patterns. 안녕하세요! 한국어로 상담이 가능합니다. <br>
In our work together, I’ll meet you with warmth and compassion, helping you explore challenges while uncovering your strengths. Therapy with me is a collaborative journey where you’ll gain tools to manage stress, ease painful emotions, and build healthier patterns. My goal is to guide you toward greater balance, resilience, and hope. <br>
Taking the first step can feel overwhelming, but you don’t have to face it alone. Therapy is a space where you can be fully heard, understood, and supported without judgment. Together we’ll build on your strengths, ease what feels heavy, and create lasting change. If you’re ready, I’d be honored to walk alongside you on your journey. <br>
