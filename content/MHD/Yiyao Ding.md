Self-identified as Asian, immigrant, and transgender, I know the challenges that our communities face. No issue is petty. As Audre Lorde powerfully put it, “caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation”. Healing and taking rest is part of being human. I want to utilize my evidence-based trainings, personal experiences, and humanity to help support your therapy journey.
