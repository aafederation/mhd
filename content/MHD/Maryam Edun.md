Welcome! My name is Maryam (she/her) and I use an integrative, client centered, strengths based approach to facilitate growth and development on your mental health journey. As a former researcher, I am passionate about measurable outcomes and evidence based practices such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFTB). I gently support my clients in developing objectives and measuring progress in a patient, empathetic and unassuming way. Working towards goals can feel overwhelming and we often find ourselves feeling stuck. Together, we break goals down into smaller, easier to manage tasks and we work to understand how to overcome the task paralysis that tends to stand in our way. <br>
I strive to create a safe, nonjudgmental space where you can fully be yourself. While obtaining my Bachelorâ€™s in Psychology from University of Central Florida and my Master of Social Work from Fordham University, I developed a passion for human rights and social justice. My experiences as a Guyanese-American, daughter of immigrants, with Asian and Native American heritage, provide me with unique insight and understanding of the various nuances of intersectionality and the complex ways in which ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, and religion can affect an individual. I recognize the strength it takes to overcome the stigma and various challenges associated with choosing to embark on your mental health journey, especially for certain populations. My work focuses on supporting you through this process of empowerment and becoming a healthier version of yourself. <br>
