I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania and received my Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Columbia University. I received my predoctoral clinical training at various psychiatric facilities in New York City, including NYU Child Study Center, Columbia University Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, and Woodhull Medical Center. Upon graduation, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at NewYork-Presbyterian, Westchester Division, where I gained further expertise in providing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for anxiety in children and adults of all ages. I am bilingual and am able to conduct therapy in English and Bengali.
