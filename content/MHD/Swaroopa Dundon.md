As an immigrant, woman of color I am sensitive to the unique issues that come up for first and second generation immigrants and approach them through a lens of compassion and non judgmental listening. I love to work with adolescents, adults, couples and families around a range of issues including depression, anxiety, self-esteem, substance use, co-dependency, parenting, familial relationships, transitions and trauma. I have an eclectic style and combine elements of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, family systems, mindfulness and positive psychology in my work. I believe that a client-centered, strengths-based approach is the foundation of a successful therapeutic journey. In addition, I am a Level 1 certified Iyengar yoga teacher and enjoy incorporating elements of yogic breathwork in sessions with clients.
