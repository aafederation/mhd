My name is Elizabeth Coritt and I am a licensed clinical social worker with a private practice. I received my graduate degree from Fordham University. I am licensed in both NY and CT. I offer in person and virtual therapy sessions, located in White Plains. I work with individuals, couples and families. I specialize in Family Therapy and have extensive post-graduate training at the Family Institute of Westchester.
