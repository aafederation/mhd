I am a nonbinary, queer, mixed race, Chinese American therapist with a thorough background serving queer people of color.  I help people work through a variety of challenges, such as depression, anxiety, sexual trauma, abuse, relationship issues, life transitions, generational trauma, substance use, financial hardships, and more. <br>
My approach to therapy is non-hierarchical and collaborative, with an emphasis on finding balance between building deeper self-insight and creating tangible, actionable steps forward.  I integrate a variety of modalities into my approach, drawing from person-centered, psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, somatic, and existential therapies. <br>
