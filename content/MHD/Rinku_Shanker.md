As the daughter of immigrants, I have a deep passion for supporting immigrants and first-generation Americans. I understand the unique challenges that can come with balancing family expectations, cultural values, and personal goals. I strive to create a space where all parts of your experience are welcomed and understood. <br>
My approach to therapy is collaborative and relationship-centered. I believe that a strong, trusting connection is the foundation of meaningful work. I take time to get to know you and tailor therapy to your individual needs, drawing from a variety of therapeutic strategies to create a personalized and supportive experience. Together, we will identify an approach that feels right for you and supports your growth, resilience, and well-being. <br>
As a PsyPact provider, I can work with individual in over 40 states. <br>
