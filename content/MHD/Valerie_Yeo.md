I offer individual therapy for adults using an integrative and collaborative approach, with the goal of creating an environment where clients can explore their values, uncover ways in which their sociopolitical context influences their identity, and move toward agency and autonomy.  I approach all therapy with emphases on decolonization, social justice, and anti-oppressive practices. Specifically, I have expertise in working with trauma, the impact of oppression, Asian American mental health, individuals who are considering leaving or have left religious and spiritual communities, sexual identity and gender exploration, polyamory and kink communities, and college-age and early-adult development. <br>
I received my doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the University of Denver, an APA-accredited program, in 2015.  I completed an APA-accredited doctoral internship with Community Reach Center, a community mental health center in Commerce City, CO; and a post-doctoral residency with Reed College Health and Counseling Center in Portland, OR. I have worked in many settings, including universities, community mental health centers, and residential facilities. In addition to the work in my practice, I enjoy working with psychology and counseling trainees in supervision, mentorship, and teaching roles. I believe strongly in fostering connection between all parts of ourselves: emotional, somatic, mental, spiritual, and social, within our present and historical contexts. <br>
I am licensed in Oregon (#2700), Washington (PY61575803), and New York (#026581). <br>
