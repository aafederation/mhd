As a licensed clinical psychologist, my priority is to create an inviting, supportive, and collaborative therapy relationship in which clients feel safe enough to do the hard but rewarding work of pursuing personal growth and healing. I strive to always meet clients where they are with genuine care and curiosity about all parts of themselves, especially the parts that have been harder to acknowledge and accept. I have a particular interest in and passion for trauma work and issues around multicultural/biracial identities. I approach therapy from a culturally sensitive psychodynamic perspective and have extensive experience with trauma. I will work with you to meet your unique needs with transparency, warmth, and perseverance. I also integrate cognitive-behavioral, mindfulness-based, and problem-solving interventions as needed to best meet your individual goals.
