AS YOU EMBARK on your healing journey, I am here to provide support, fostering a nurturing and secure space that empowers you to rediscover your truest self. I highly value the therapeutic relationship and cherish your individual experience, tailoring my treatment to meet your needs and goals. My approach centers on being genuinely present and authentic, urging you to delve deeper into self-exploration and fortify your self-connection. I employ a mindful, client-centered, integrated approach utilizing various therapies to better understand your past and identify ways to support your present-day and future self. <br>
HUMAN BEINGS are inherently resilient, and the work we do together can help harness your inner strength to overcome challenges and achieve emotional well-being. Throughout our collaboration, I prioritize acknowledging and respecting your emotions while recognizing their significance.  My approach involves fostering curiosity to confront and break down internalized biases and negative self-beliefs, ultimately guiding my clients toward embracing their compassionate selves. <br>
AS A FIRST-GENERATION South Asian woman, I warmly embrace diversity and specialize in working with individuals from diverse backgrounds and unique identities. With a trauma-informed perspective, I bring a wealth of experience and training to help individuals cope with trauma, anxiety, life transitions, depression, cultural and religious complexities, and the everyday stresses of life. <br>
MY UNWAVERING COMMITMENT is to empower you with the skills needed to navigate life's myriad challenges, equipping you with a valuable toolkit of resources and techniques. Recognizing that the first and often most daunting step is merely showing up, and I would consider it an honor to accompany you on this journey. <br>
