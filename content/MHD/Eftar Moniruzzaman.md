If you are looking for support and guidance through life experiences and challenges, I am here to provide support. I aim to provide a safe space where you can feel comfortable enough to go through this healing journey. I want you to trust me enough to be able to communicate the things that you are feeling, thinking, and things you want to change. My primary goal is to work with you to create the changes that best fit you, and make any changes along the way. <br>
Some specialties that I can offer include; anxiety, depression, and coping mechanisms. I prefer a client focused and cognitive behavioral approach. This way we can explore how you are feeling, discuss any behaviors or thoughts that may be causing you stress or anxiety, and work together to change them. <br>
