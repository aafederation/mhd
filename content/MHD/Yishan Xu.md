Hello, I am Dr. Yishan Xu, a clinical psychologist licensed in California, New York, and Virginia, a Board-Certified behavioral sleep medicine specialist (DBSM) and an AASECT Board-Certified Sex Therapist (CST). Currently, I serve as the chair of the Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine (SBSM) OPEC committee, a committee member of the International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health (ISSWSH), and the adjunct clinical faculty at the School of Medicine of Stanford University. <br>
I am the founder and director of our clinic: Mind & Body Garden Psychology. We are one of California's largest multilingual mental health clinics, with 20+ psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists, etc., and other satellite offices in New York Manhattan. <br>
I combine evidence-based intervention methods with a holistic lifestyle medicine approach, and provide 3 clinical specialties: 1) treatment for sleep disorders such as insomnia/circadian rhythm disorders, 2) treatment for sexual dysfunction, promoting sexual well-being, IVF-related psychotherapy & assessment; and 3) treatment for children/teen mental health. <br>
I always see the role of a psychologist as a gardener. When people come to us seeking support, they may have too many branches of mental blocks and bushes of stress in their lives. What we can do is to help people be more aware of the branches and bushes that impact their quality of life, and then assist them to trim these parts, cope with stress, and live healthier and happier lives. <br>
I grew up in China and speak both Mandarin and English. I strongly advocate evidence-based treatment to develop a more positive attitude, and to build a life that is happier, more balanced, and more meaningful. Many of my clients have a hard time dealing with stress or transitions in life. Others may use some help with improving communication and relationship. They all have a common desire to take active steps to make meaningful and lasting changes. <br>
