I work collaboratively, with the purpose of understanding your goals and learning how to reach them. Together, we can explore internal and external barriers you face and work to diminish or navigate them. I aim to create an open space, free of judgment, to explore thoughts and feelings you may not otherwise have a place to address. One of the first steps in the journey to healing is being seen and heard authentically, and in our work together we can begin there. 

I have experience working with anxiety, depression, life transitions, relationship issues, career struggles, and experiences of racism and homophobia. I honor diversity in all of its forms. 

Whether you are caught in patterns that don’t serve you, are navigating difficult relationship dynamics, are feeling stuck, depressed or anxious, or looking to better understand what exactly it is that you’re feeling - I am here to help. I will both support and challenge you along the way. 

There is no one approach that is right for everyone, so I combine psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness styles in my practice and tailor sessions to your individual needs. The therapeutic relationship can be a space for healing, self-discovery, reflection and growth. I would love to be part of this journey with you.
