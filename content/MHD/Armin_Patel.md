While all potential clients are welcome to the practice not all providers are a “fit” for every client (and nor should they be). The clientele I generally work best with are individuals who need a safe space to verbalize their thoughts and feelings about life's challenges- be it day to day challenges negatively affecting their emotions; those coping with health/physical issues; processing traumas; experiencing anxiety or depression; or those needing a second opinion/consultation.  I also work with those impacted by the justice system helping them navigate the particular psychological/ psychosocial stressor nuances of mandates, pre and post sentencing, in a supportive, empathic,  and nonjudgmental manner to achieve goals, attain relief from distressing symptoms, and increase overall mental health functioning to attain and sustain a worthy and meaningful life.
