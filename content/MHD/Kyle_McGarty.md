I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (#006524) and Certified Bioenergetic Therapist (CBT) in New York City. I graduated from Teacherâ€™s College, Columbia University with a Master of Education in Mental Health Counseling and Master of Arts in Psychological Counseling. I have over 10 years of psychotherapy experience working with diverse populations of adolescents and adults. I specialize in anxiety, depression, relationship problems, men's issues, LGBTQ, and adoption. Prior to my graduate studies, I was fortunate to live and work in South America for a year, where I taught English as a Second Language. My journey to becoming a therapist began as an anxious and depressed teenager who reluctantly gave in to therapy only to discover support and acceptance that I had rarely felt before. Since then, I have dedicated my professional life to accompanying others along their journeys of healing and self discovery.
