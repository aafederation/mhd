I've been an English/ Mandarin bilingual therapist for 21 years; I've been treating stress due to school, employment, immigration problems, interpersonal difficulties related to the original family, and interracial relationships. My approaches combine Eastern philosophy/holistic/mindfulness practice and professional training utilizing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), psychodynamics, attachment-based, solution-focused, and strength-based approaches.
