Growing up in a bi-cultural household, I know what it’s like to navigate family expectations while finding my own path as a first-generation Asian-American. Balancing personal goals with cultural responsibilities, figuring out your own path while honoring your heritage, and navigating family dynamics can feel overwhelming. My background helps me connect with and support multicultural individuals as they explore generational conflicts, relationships, and the tension between personal ambitions and cultural values. <br>
I offer an integrative, person-centered approach with a multicultural lens, blending psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and acceptance-based techniques. Together, we explore how past experiences shape your present, identify patterns holding you back, and develop practical tools for growth. <br>
I deeply value the therapeutic relationship as the foundation for meaningful change. Built on trust, respect, and collaboration, this safe space allows you to discover your strengths, resilience, and the ability to navigate life’s challenges. Whether facing identity questions, family pressures, or major life transitions, I provide culturally responsive guidance to help you gain self-understanding, confidence, and a life aligned with your values. <br>
