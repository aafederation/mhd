Hello! My name is Dr. Debleena Das and I am a licensed clinical psychologist able to see clients in NY & NJ. Do you feel overwhelmed navigating certain aspects of your life or finding yourself having difficulty with a new transition? Are you struggling with feelings of loneliness, entering the world of dating for the first time or processing a break-up? In my work, I strive to use a client-centered, strengths-based approach as I believe that each person who seeks me out is unique and deserves a tailored approach to match their needs and personality. I bring warmth, compassion and a touch of humor into the room as I find these are all important aspects in fostering a strong therapeutic alliance that feels safe & collaborative. 

Additionally, I pride myself in working from a culturally sensitive lens and can provide perspective on the generational impact of the immigrant experience. I have had the privilege of working with clients from a breadth of cultural and religious backgrounds, as well as various gender and sexual orientations. My experiences range across the developmental spectrum (ages 3-60). My understanding of parent-child relationships and the roots of events throughout the life-span help me better conceptualize and draw connections to some of the issues you might be encountering at present. Additionally, I point out patterns, ways of thinking & behaviors that might be causing current distress in your life. I work especially well with adolescents, college students, and graduate/medical students. My clients are often struggling with familial relationships, romantic relationships, life transitions, identity issues, multicultural issues, LGBTQ issues, and/or overcoming trauma. Please reach out if the above resonates with you, I look forward to hearing from you.
