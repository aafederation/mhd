Desi Rainbow Parents & Allies was conceived in 2017 for South Asian families and friends of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning individuals to learn about LGBTQ+ issues, find community with one another and learn how to better support their loved ones. We serve Desi individuals and families who trace their origins to South Asia, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives. Our mission is to foster understanding and acceptance among families, with the goal of affirming and celebrating our LGBTQ+ loved ones.
