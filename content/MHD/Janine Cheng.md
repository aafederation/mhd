In my 10 + years of clinical practice, I’ve found that I do my best work with clients who identify as people-pleasers, perfectionists, caretakers and with couples working through differences in attachment styles (specialty in anxious attachment). They often struggle with setting healthy boundaries or with tolerating the discomfort of conflict. Their lives may be characterized by a chronic need to please others, a fear of being disliked/abandoned, and an overwhelming feeling of being undervalued and misunderstood. <br>
Additionally, much of my work is with members of the Asian diaspora, many of whom are children of immigrants and find themselves navigating generational differences in acculturation, values and functioning. <br>
My work centers around understanding the way patterns in relationships and in behavior, thought and emotion connect with  formative experiences. I believe that insight combined with intentional skill-building leads to sustainable change that will actually help clients to feel better and move through the world in more authentic and fulfilling ways. <br>
Learning to set boundaries, to identify and communicate needs, to ground in one’s own experience rather than in the experience of others, to tend to one’s body and mind are all part of that healing.  Much of healing wounds involves moving through the related pain, recognizing where old patterns have locked us into that pain and learning to find a different, reparative way forward. I look forward to forging that path with you. <br>
