Turning Point for Women and Familiesâ€™ mission is to help Muslim women and girls affected by domestic violence to empower themselves and transform their own lives as well as those of their families. Turning Point provides a diversified range of culturally competent services focused on safety and self-sufficiency through direct services, advocacy and referrals.

Deeply rooted in the Muslim community, Turning Point believes that social change can be effected by raising awareness about the prevalence and effects of domestic violence, addressing it directly and offering safe spaces and opportunities for youth development.
