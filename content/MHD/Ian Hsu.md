I specialize in helping adults from diverse backgrounds struggling with stress, anxiety, depression, "overthinking," perfectionism, relationships, self-esteem, and loneliness. <br>
I work well with people who are considering medication for the first time, or who want to be careful with side effects or dosages -- I believe in a thoughtful blend of talk therapy and medication use. <br>
