Welcome to Makabe Counseling Services
If you’re reading this…
I'm at a turning point in my life
For some reason, things that I've been able to solve on my own until now are now difficult
Or, I want to live a more fulfilling life.
You may be feeling that way. <br>
It is said that humans are social creatures.
Whether we like it or not, we live in a society. We communicate with the people around us, get used to new environments, and achieve our dreams and goals. <br>
However, when something happens that disrupts our lives, we feel distress, anger, sadness, etc. As a result, we become depressed, overeat, experience insomnia, etc. <br>
At the root of it all is a cry from the heart for someone to listen.
In most cases, we confide in close friends or family, but some of you may have felt better by confiding in a third party when you feel hesitant to talk to them or they are not nearby. <br>
The counselor plays the role of that "third party." <br>
