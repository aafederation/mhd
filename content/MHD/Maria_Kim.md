I am a Yale trained psychiatrist and therapist in private practice in CT and NY. I offer a warm and collaborative approach to mental health care. My two areas of focus are psychotherapy (individual & couples) and integrative psychiatry which may include prescription medications, mind-body practices, and lifestyle modifications. I draw from a variety of psychological approaches. <br>
I find it deeply meaningful to work with those committed to addressing their concerns together. Concerns include the impact of trauma, relationship difficulties, depression, anxiety, ADHD, work-related stress/burnout, life transitions like loss and grief, questions around meaning and identity, unwanted behaviors and emotional patterns. <br>
I aim to provide a safe space for authentic connection, where you feel seen and understood and can make meaningful change. I am also a clinician on psychedelic-assisted therapy research at Yale. This treatment is not yet available outside of research settings in NY and CT, but I do offer integration consultations, and ketamine assisted psychotherapy. <br>
