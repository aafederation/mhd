Do you ever feel overwhelmed with life’s challenges? Does your anxiety interfere with your ability to function? Everyone has a story – a past, present and a future, which can be understood with some support and guidance. Living in the city and juggling responsibilities tends to overburden our systems. Unresolved traumas often appear in new and existing relationships without our awareness. I am here to walk with you and support you in telling your story. 

I lean into an eclectic and integrative approach when working with clients, one that uses aspects of psychodynamic therapy, feminist therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. I operate from a trauma-informed and multicultural background, and will meet you where you are.Through unconditional positive regard, empathy, and compassion, I help individuals overcome a multitude of life hurdles. Coming from a Middle-Eastern immigrant background has allowed me to recognize the intersections of multiple identities within a therapeutic journey, in addition to the impact of cultural nuances on our mental wellbeing. 

Your presence on this page is not a coincidence, and in fact indicates your willingness to make meaningful changes to your life. If you feel ready to embark on this journey, I encourage you to contact me and set up an appointment. Reaching out and starting therapy is not always easy, but I will support you in enhancing your story.
