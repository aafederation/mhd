Hello, I'm Dr. Shirley Ley. I know what it feels like to be the one who holds it all together. I understand the weight of family expectations, the complexity of living between cultures, and the exhaustion that comes from perpetual striving. My work centers cultural and ancestral experiences because I believe our healing needs space that honors both individual struggle and collective wisdom. We don't need to choose between honoring our families and honoring ourselves.
