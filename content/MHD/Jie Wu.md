Hi, I am a bilingual (Mandarin) therapist in NYC and surrounding area with 15 years of clinical experience supporting children, couples, and families. My client-centered approach is warm, compassionate, and tailored to each individual’s needs. I have worked with diverse populations in child welfare, psychiatric centers, and the education system, helping clients navigate challenges such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, and relationship issues. My goal is to provide a safe and supportive space where clients can explore their experiences, gain clarity, and find greater meaning and fulfillment in life <br>
I use approaches like CBT, TF CBT, Family Therapy, EFT,ABFT, Narrative and Psychoanalysis. Since no single method fits all, I tailor therapy to each client’s needs. My goal is to support personal growth and help clients navigate challenges in a way that aligns with their goals <br>
We deserve support on our life journey, and we don’t have to navigate it alone. No matter where we are right now, there are always possibilities for healing and growth. Let’s talk about what’s possible for you <br>
I have a private practice.  I also work at Scarsdale Edgemont Family Counseling Service (SFSC) [https://www.sfcsinc.org](https://www.sfcsinc.org) where I can be reached at (914) 723-3281 or [info@sfcsinc.org](mailto:info@sfcsinc.org)
