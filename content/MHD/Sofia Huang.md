I strive to co-create a warm, supportive therapeutic relationship with both individuals and couples, which honors the difficult work of exploring vulnerabilities and fostering growth in therapy. My background in abolitionist, decolonial, and anti-oppressive work influences how I explore clients’ experiences within the context of family, relationships, and broader histories and sociopolitical conditions. My approach is integrative and draws on a range of approaches including psychoanalytic, relational, trauma-informed (EMDR), and behavioral (CBT/DBT) modalities. I have a training background and interest in working with intersectional identity concerns, intergenerational/relationship conflict and violence, immigration, non monogamy/polyamory, neurodivergence, depression, anxiety, and trauma.
