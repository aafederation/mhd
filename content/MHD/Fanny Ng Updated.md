I am a licensed clinical psychologist who works with individuals throughout New York and New Jersey. My specialties include the treatment of anxiety, depression, grief, and trauma. I also help folks manage caregiver stress and burnout, sleep disorders, chronic pain, cancer, and other health issues. <br>
I practice from a feminist multicultural perspective that is LGBTQIA+ affirming. My work empowers my diverse clients to thrive in a complex society and uncover what matters to them most. I enjoy helping people regain their inner strength during difficult moments in their lives. Together, we’ll explore issues related to identity, race, culture, gender, work, and family. <br>
Therapy is an investment in yourself and your invaluable well-being. My wish in our work together is to help you to:
Experience relief from the burdens holding you back from living a full life
Find effective strategies to manage and resolve overlapping problems
Develop more meaningful, authentic, and fulfilling relationships with yourself and others
Cope better with life changes related to relocation, work, school, grief and illness <br>
My approach is collaborative and tailored to your unique needs. I integrate Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and mindfulness practices. <br>
If you’d like to learn more about how I can help you, please schedule a free 30-minute phone consultation with me. <br>
I also offer therapy in Cantonese.
