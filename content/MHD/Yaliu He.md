I am an Associate Professor in the Marriage and Family Therapy Department at Iona University, with over 15 years of experience in clinical practice, training, and research. Prior to that, I completed a two-year clinical postdoctoral fellowship at The Family Institute at Northwestern University. I hold a Ph.D. in Family Science from the University of Minnesota and a Master’s in Applied Psychology from Tsinghua University in China. <br>
I offer in-person and virtual psychotherapy services in Scarsdale, Westchester County and throughout New York State. I specialize in couples therapy, helping couples strengthen their relationships, as well as adolescent and family therapy to improve parent-adolescent dynamics and reduce adolescent depression and anxiety. Additionally, I provide individual therapy focused on enhancing mothers' well-being, alleviating depression and anxiety, managing parenting stress, and improving work-life balance. I am an expert in Integrative Systemic Therapy, blending various evidence-based approaches to tailor treatment to each client's unique needs. <br>
Growing up in a culture where mental health issues and family conflicts were taboo, I often felt confusion and shame about acknowledging their impact on my life and others. Over time, I’ve learned that when people face their challenges, those challenges lose their grip and gradually fade. My mission as a psychotherapist is to help break the stigma around seeking help and empower you to build the life and relationships you desire. While fear and avoidance are natural, taking the first step toward therapy can lead to profound change. Each small step can transform how you feel and strengthen your relationships in ways you might not have imagined. <br>
