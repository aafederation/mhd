I have over 15 years of experience practicing mindful living, meditation, and instructing others in mindfulness-based practices, before as a Buddhist monk, and now as a mental health counselor. I specialize in helping people manage their anxiety, depression, cravings, and anger, as well as minimize problematic judgment and rumination. I’m skilled at helping my clients clarify their life direction. I’m bilingual, speaking Mandarin Chinese as well as English, and I have years of counseling experience working with Chinese-American people suffering from chronic & severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis. I’ve lived in Chinese cultural environments for years, and in this way, I believe I’m also fluent in the Asian-American cultural overlap.
