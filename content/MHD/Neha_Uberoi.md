I help individuals overcome emotional and behavioral challenges that get in the way of living a high quality life.  I provide a space for clients to clearly identify their challenges and unlock  better beliefs, solution oriented systems of thinking and behaving that increase their mental/emotional resilience for sustained success. <br>
I use the mindsets learned as a professional athlete, coupled with training in evidence-based interventions of clinical social work to facilitate the change my clients are seeking. <br>
