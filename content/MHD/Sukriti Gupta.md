Hi, I’m Dr. Sukriti Gupta—a South Asian therapist with advanced doctoral and master’s-level training in marriage and family therapy. I specialize in helping individuals, couples, and families break unhealthy cycles, navigate cultural and generational differences, and build deeper, more authentic connections. <br>
My clients are often high-achieving professionals or adult children of immigrants who are struggling with anxiety, relationships, or identity—people who “look fine” on the outside but feel stuck, unheard, or emotionally overwhelmed inside. You might be tired of people-pleasing, carrying unspoken family expectations, or feeling torn between independence and loyalty. I get it—and you don’t have to do this alone. <br>
With extensive clinical training and a doctorate in mental health, I combine evidence-based therapy with cultural sensitivity. Whether we’re working on boundary-setting, intergenerational trauma, or reconnecting with your partner, you’ll find our sessions grounded, empowering, and attuned to your lived experience. <br>
Therapy with me is not one-size-fits-all—it’s collaborative, culturally responsive, and deeply focused on helping you feel safe, seen, and supported. If you're ready to invest in yourself and create real change, let’s connect. I offer a free 15-minute consultation. <br>
