Iâ€™m Dr. Cheryl Gelley, a licensed psychologist and nationally certified school psychologist. I am experienced in providing therapy for a wide range of concerns. Common therapy topics include anxiety, depression, social skills, adjustment to life transitions, and managing stress and/or anger. I am authorized to provide telehealth services across several states, including New York (convenient for frequent travel and/or college students). At this time, I only have openings for clients in New York via telehealth.
