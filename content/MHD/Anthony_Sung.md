Hey there, my name is Anthony and I became a therapist and created Crossroads Haven Counseling because I experienced significant healing and growth when I was at several "crossroads" in my life and got help from professional psychotherapists, mentors, and spiritual leaders. I realized how important it was to talk to someone outside of my immediate family and friends. I've traveled the world, studied abroad, and lived in various cities in America, which was amazing but at the same time challenging. That's why I needed someone professional in my corner throughout.
