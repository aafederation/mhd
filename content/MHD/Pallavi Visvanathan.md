I specialize in treating depression and anxiety disorders (OCD, generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety) as well as insomnia, relationship issues, and coping with chronic illness and pain. I have extensive training and expertise in both cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). I aim to help clients develop the skills to cope better with life's difficulties while more fully experiencing joy and life satisfaction.
