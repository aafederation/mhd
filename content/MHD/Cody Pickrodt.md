My approach is person centered and psychodynamic. I use
evidence-based therapeutic practices with a foundation in existential
therapy. Together, we can uncover the "why," so you may live with any
"how." <br>
I specialize in personality disorders, anger management, resilience
building, adjustments/transitions, trauma, anxiety, depression,
sleep/insomnia, career counseling/vocational rehabilitation,
relationships/dating, the addiction recovery process and smoking
cessation. <br>
Our work together would be collaborative and personalized to your
needs. The initiative to enter therapy demonstrates the will to
change. The hardest part in most journeys may be the first step. You
would not be alone, and you have my support all the way.
