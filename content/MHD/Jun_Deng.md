I am a licensed Creative Arts Therapist at New York State. I am specialized in working with international students, Asian family, people struggling with depression, anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, intimate relationships, interpersonal relationships, grief and loss, trauma and career issue. I take a holistic, integrative and relational approach to mental health, meeting people where they are and as a whole person rather than a diagnosis to be fixed. Living in this ever-changing world can be difficult and frustrating, and we all need to be seen, felt, connected. All the big changes you are looking for always begin with a small step.
