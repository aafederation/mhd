I am a first-generation Chinese American woman born and raised in New York.  My cultural background is of Chinese and Korean descent.  My family's history is shaped by survival and migration.  My grandparents fled China to resettle in Korea as refugees seeking to escape the intensification of the Chinese Communist Revolution.  My family's complex legacy of displacement, cultural negotiation, and perseverance has shaped my identity, both personally and professionally.  My family's background in the impact of generational trauma and survival has instilled a deep understanding of cultural dislocation, and being "othered" has taught me how to approach marginalized and underrepresented populations with sensitivity, curiosity, and compassion.  <br>
I have had the privilege to working with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community and those identified as gender nonconforming/nonbinary, people living with HIV+, and other disenfranchised populations. I am also specialized in working with children, teenagers, and young adults, navigating life transitions, and addressing anxiety, depression, grief, codependency, trauma, and emotional and behavioral difficulties. <br>
I strive to meet clients where they're at and aim to create a safe, supportive environment where exploration of the inner world can take place.  I tailor each therapeutic experience to the unique needs and strengths of each client, fostering a space of respect and empowerment that helps them move toward healing and self-discovery.  <br>
