I am a Mental Health Counselor licensed in the State of New York. I graduated from Medaille University in 2023 with a Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. Since then, I’ve focused on continuing to learn and grow through my work in the field. My approach is client-centered and informed by evidence-based practices, with attention to each person’s unique experiences, identity, and goals. I believe therapy works best when it feels safe, authentic, and collaborative.
