Bring it on! I offer a uniquely compassionate, shame-free environment to discuss all aspects of sexuality and gender. I thrive on topics exploring alternative sexual attractions, kink/fetish, sex and gender identity, male sexuality, confidence, and shame – no topic is too taboo! My aim is to help you embrace your desires fully, so that you can find pleasure that is healthy, lasting, and rooted in confidence rather than shame. <br>
Visit my website to read more about my specialties, education, and how I work with clients. When you’re ready to begin, feel free to contact me to set up a 15-minute consultation call prior to scheduling your first session! <br>
