As a Native New Yorker with over 8 years of experience, I deeply resonate with you if you are high-achieving or people-pleasing, yet still find yourself prioritizing others over yourself. You want to appear to be put together, but deep down, you are struggling to thrive in your authentic self. I am a Queer, Chinese/Taishanese therapist, carving out space to foster greater connection to your lineages, roots, and embodied self-awareness.
