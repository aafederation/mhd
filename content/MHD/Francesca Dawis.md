Francesca Dawis, LMSW, is a psychotherapist who guides patients navigating life transitions and trauma toward healing and self-discovery. She enjoys working with individuals of diverse backgrounds who seek to transform their relationship with themselves and the world around them. <br>
Francesca’s therapeutic approach is deeply informed by a political framework that embraces principles of social justice, liberation, and systems-based awareness. She integrates this perspective to help patients explore how broader social and structural dynamics—such as race, gender, sexuality, and class—affect their personal experiences and mental health. Francesca received her Bachelor’s Degree (BA) in Psychology from Stanford University and her Master’s in Social Work (MSW) from Columbia University. <br>
In addition to her therapeutic work, Francesca is a violinist and singer-actor. This artistic background enriches her therapeutic practice, allowing her to bring creativity, emotional depth, and a nuanced understanding of expression into her work with patients. <br>
