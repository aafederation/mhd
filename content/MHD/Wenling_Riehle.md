I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Credentialed Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Master Counselor, and a yoga instructor with 20 years of self-practice. Specializing in therapy for adults with dual diagnoses and multicultural backgrounds, I also have extensive experience working with children of different abilities. My expertise encompasses anxiety, trauma work, and family dynamics, providing a kind, nurturing space for our collaborative journey towards self-acceptance.
