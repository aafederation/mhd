Michiko was inspired by the healing power of acupuncture when she faced her own health issues and difficulties in her personal life. Acupuncture treatments along with yoga and meditation helped alleviate her condition tremendously and motivated her to help others in the same way. Mindful, patient-centered acupuncture is her philosophy, which allows her to integrate different modalities, including her primary method of Japanese-style acupuncture, in her painless and gentle treatment options. <br>
Her special interest is care for pre- and post-menopausal women (and men) who undergo various changes in life that can result in negative symptoms, both physical and emotional. <br>
She also has a passion for helping underprivileged people in developing countries and volunteered at a clinic in a rural village in Nepal (Bajrabarahi) via a nonprofit organization (Acupuncture Relief Project) in March-April 2023 to help extremely underprivileged patients. More info about her volunteer work in Nepal is available at her blog. She also has been volunteering at the Hope Lodge run by the American Cancer Society, Inc. and New York Harm Reduction Educators. <br>
She received an M.A. in Media Studies and worked as a writer & journalist for various media outlets in Japan and the U.S. before becoming a doctor of acupuncture and earning acupuncture licenses in NY and NJ States. <br>
Michiko continues her studies of medicine with a passion to increase the store of knowledge to better serve patients and produce positive results.
