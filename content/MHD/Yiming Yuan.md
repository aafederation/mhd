I am a psychotherapist licensed in New York State. I trained at Adelphi University, William Alanson White Institute and Ackerman Institute for the Family, which includes in-depth training in mental health counseling, interpersonal psychoanalytic and family therapy theories and practice. The people I have worked with have a variety of difficulties, including experiences of depression, anxiety, migration stress, challenges from minority identity, workplace burnout, couple and parent-child relational problems. I work with clients through a multicultural and interpersonal lens, guiding them to recognize and embrace the strengths they inherently possess.
