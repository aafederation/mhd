Itâ€™s always been my desire to work in the Mental Health setting caring for others. My experience entails areas concerning trauma, transition, anxiety, depression and suffering. It can be a challenge when it comes to dealing with the demand of everyday living to put your Mental Health as a priority but take this time to improve your self-care. Please make the first step toward mental peace by reaching out for a session. Put your brain as a priority as you would your physical health. <br>
My approach as a therapist is predominantly from a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy perspective. This allows me to help my clients identify their thoughts and behaviors around their relationships, triggers, family dynamics and childhood issues/trauma. Using both eclectic and humanistic approach to accentuates the significance of being your true self in order to be the most fulfilling and best version of yourself. <br>
My clients can expect to gain coping skills, strategies to help cope with their life changes, build their self-esteem/confidence and identify why one behavior is the way it is. Focus on communication skills, assertiveness skills, setting appropriate boundaries and setting limits to get your life back toward peace. Before we can set up an appointment, an intake package should be completed. <br>
