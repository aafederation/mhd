Hi, I’m Brintha! I’m here to listen and guide healing conversations that bring you clarity, peace and balance. I provide a safe and welcoming space to help you tune into your inner voice, explore your experiences and create a healing path forward. I use a trauma-informed, anti-oppression and strengths-based approach that prioritizes my clients’ identities and values to help them achieve their goals. I work with: BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ individuals; South Asian and immigrant populations, including those born to immigrant families; All survivors of trauma including gender-based violence and systemic racism; Activists, advocates and community organizers who experience vicarious trauma. I embrace cultural humility and somatic awareness in my therapy practice. I have been in the Social Work field for 15+ years, currently undergoing training in Integrative Somatic Trauma Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). I am also currently in a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training.
