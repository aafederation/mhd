I am a Licensed Clinical Psychologist and the founder of Maleh Psychology. <br>
With an integrative and relational approach, I specialize in working with children, families, and individuals navigating life transitions, emotional challenges, and relationship dynamics. I have specialized training in parent-child psychotherapy and am dedicated to supporting families as they strengthen connection, resilience, and emotional well-being across all stages of development. <br>
I am licensed in New York and work with patients both in-person at my office in Scarsdale, NY or via telehealth online. <br>
