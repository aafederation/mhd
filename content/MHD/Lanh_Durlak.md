I am a BIPOC licensed mental health counselor who received my master's degree from the University of Rochester in 2014 in Community Mental Health Counseling. I am a National Certified Counselor and I am endorsed within NYS in Infant Mental Health. <br>
Since graduating, I've worked as an intensive in-home therapist for children and families meeting criteria for serious emotional disturbance, a chemical dependency counselor working primarily with the older adults, and a therapeutic visitation clinician offering family therapy in the context of visitations. <br>
I was born in Vietnam and emigrated to the States with my family at the tender age of 4. I've experienced "helpers" all throughout my life and recognize how impactful and necessary they have been in my journey into adulthood. I firmly believe that everyone develops best in the context of healthy and supportive relationships. I have two amazing children who remind me daily of the healing power of my relationship with them. <br>
