I’m a queer, Filipino-American, and child of immigrants. I use he/him/his pronouns. I grew up in the Seattle area, and spent most of my adult life in New York City.  <br>
I offer insight-oriented therapy and EMDR therapy for adults dealing with a range of issues, including multicultural and LGBTQ+ concerns, shame, anxiety, depression, trauma, and life transitions. <br>
I aim to build a therapeutic relationship that deepens your self-understanding and helps you navigate life more effectively. I invite you to bring your full self to our sessions—your strengths, challenges, hopes, fears, and intersecting identities. <br>
I hope to support you in your journey, in ways that are adaptive, responsive, and encourage growth. <br>
