I support adults and adolescents struggling with anxiety, depression, stress, learning challenges, and ADHD to build coping skills and develop skills for resilience and self-trust. <br>
My approach integrates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and behavioral science through a culturally-attuned lens to help you recognize patterns, gain insight, and apply effective strategies in daily life. I also provide adult ADHD assessments to clarify executive functioning challenges and guide treatment. <br>
