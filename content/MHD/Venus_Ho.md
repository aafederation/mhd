Hi, my name is Venus and I am a bilingual therapist based in New York. I believe healing happens when we feel truly seen and accepted as our authentic selves. I am dedicated to creating a warm, welcoming space where clients can share their thoughts, feelings, and challenges without judgment. I work from a compassionate and collaborative approach, partnering with clients to navigate difficulties, uncover inner strengths, and deepen self-awareness. My goal is to support clients in finding peace and healing, even in lifeâ€™s toughest moments. <br>
As a second-generation immigrant, I have a deep appreciation for the complexities of navigating multiple cultural identities. I strive to honor the unique stories of my clients and to explore how their identities shape their experiences. I believe that acknowledging and exploring cultural dynamics is an important part of the healing journey. <br>
I have worked in community and healthcare settings, providing mental health support to individuals facing depression, anxiety, relationship issues, and other life stressors. I practice from an anti-oppressive and trauma-informed lens and integrate various modalities, including mindfulness, somatic, and CBT techniques, to best support clients. <br>
I currently offer both in-person and virtual appointments. If you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out to intake\@humantold.com. I also offer a free 10 minute consultation call to help you explore if we're a good fit. <br>
