Hi, I’m Irene! Working with me feels like having a teammate in your corner. I’m warm, down-to-earth, and not afraid to sprinkle in a little humor when it helps. I’ll support you, challenge you when needed, and celebrate every bit of progress along the way. <br>
I work with adults, teens, and families of all types. I have a special focus on survivors of domestic violence and members of South Asian communities. I understand how cultural values, generational differences, and family expectations can shape your experiences, and I’m here to help you navigate those complexities with care and compassion. <br>
Whether you’re healing from past trauma, managing stress, or trying to better understand yourself, my goal is to help you feel empowered and hopeful about your future. <br>
