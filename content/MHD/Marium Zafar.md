Marium Zafar, Psy.D. is a licensed clinical psychologist who has been practicing in New York City since 2011. Dr. Zafar values the therapeutic relationship as an integral component of change that often comes from individuals gaining insight into their lives, their relationships and how they view themselves and the world. She implements a cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal framework for therapy, while remaining flexible with this approach and treating people within their cultural context. Dr. Zafar believes collaboration is crucial in order for therapy to feel successful. As a woman of South Asian descent, she knows how difficult it can be to find a provider who understands your unique experiences and respecting one's culture is a priority in my work. She help people of all ages and backgrounds, and specialize in treating South Asian women.
