You desire emotional well-being, healing & inner peace. That's why you're here. You continue to experience pain & discomfort yet don't quite know how to process & work through it all. Your story & life experiences should be heard & understood. As a minority identifying therapist & child of immigrants, my lived experiences help me connect with my clients on a deeper level. With this understanding, you can expect to better balance your intersecting identities across life domains. You are deserving of validation & empathy.I enjoy working with college students, adoptees, generational trailblazers, adults of all ages, BIPOC individuals, minorities, marginalized groups, first generation & immigrant individuals. My goal is to help you overcome and heal from trauma & other struggles. My specialty training is developmental trauma. We will work collaboratively to meet your goals. <br>
Thereâ€™s strength in vulnerability. We will process your feelings and experiences in safe space, work through barriers, & build self-regulatory skills to thrive. During the therapeutic journey, you will be validated, challenged and encouraged to grow. If any of the above resonates with you, please reach out. <br>
