I'm a licensed mental health therapist dedicated to providing compassionate and evidence-based care. I understand that each person's journey is unique, and I'm committed to creating a safe and supportive space for you to explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences. <br>
My approach integrates therapeutic modalities tailored to your specific needs. I'm trained in EMDR, to process distressing life events, and Inference-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for OCD. Additionally, I incorporate mindfulness-based practices to cultivate present-moment awareness and enhance your overall well-being. <br>
