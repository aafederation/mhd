I specialize in working with those who have been impacted by intimate partner/gender-based violence, childhood trauma (CPTSD), family trauma, difficult life-transitions, intergenerational trauma, and relational difficulties. I  am interested in working with those who hold marginalized identities of age, race, gender, sexuality, ability, and religion. I am passionate about walking alongside clients as they work to dismantle the role and impact of harmful power structures in their lives so that they may thrive and experience joy, ease, and euphoria in their identity. My approach is trauma-informed, warm, and relational. I believe that growth and working through the toughest life-challenges is most possible with intentional support, care, and compassion. With the understanding that we live in an oppressive system that impacts our interactions, I work and hope to disrupt oppressive patterns so that our therapeutic relationship may uplift your healing and lead to radical change and self-care.
