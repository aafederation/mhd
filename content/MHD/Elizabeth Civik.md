I am a licensed clinical social worker offering psychotherapy services to individuals in New York City. My therapeutic approach prioritizes collaboration, open-mindedness, and empathy as I learn more about who you are, what your goals are, and how to help you get there. <Br>
Utilizing trauma-informed and intersectional frameworks, my work is particularly attuned to people who have experienced difficult situations in their life, historically marginalized populations (e.g. AAPI, POC, immigrants), adoptees, and young adults. <br>
If you choose to work with me, you’ll find that I emphasize psychoeducation, values exploration, and candor. <br>
If any of this resonates, please contact me, as I might be a good match to join your therapeutic journey. <br>
