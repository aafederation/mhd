Hi, I’m Aneeta, a licensed psychologist based in New York.  I received my doctorate degree in Clinical Psychology from The Chicago School of Professional Psychology. I’ve worked in a variety of settings including college counseling, community mental health, inpatient care, and private practice, supporting adults and young adults through life’s challenges. <br>
I especially enjoy working with people who are exploring their identity, navigating relationship and family dynamics, healing from past experiences, or adjusting to big life transitions. My approach is warm, relational, and culturally responsive. I focus on building a space where you feel safe, understood, and supported. <br>
I’m licensed to practice in New York and New Jersey. <br>
