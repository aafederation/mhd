As a queer first-generation Japanese American, I am passionate about the ways in which I can advocate for mental health in all communities. Culture, environment, the multiple identities you hold, and the societal systems in place can all be significant contributors to the stressors you face. In exploring these factors collaboratively with you, I hope to empower you to recognize your strengths and to draw upon them. I work with culturally inclusive, anti-oppressive, LGBTQIA+ affirmative, and strengths-based lenses. <br>
I also recently started an Instagram page to break stigma around mental health in Japanese community @plantingseeds.jp
