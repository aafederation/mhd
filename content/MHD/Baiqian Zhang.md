Having lived and studied abroad from a young age, I bring both personal insight and professional understanding to the complexities of life between cultures. Balancing multiple identities and navigating constant transitions can feel like a lot to manage, especially while also adjusting to new cultures, pursuing academic and professional goals, and maintaining relationships across distances. My background helps me create a space where you feel seen, understood, and supported as you explore your path, build confidence, and cultivate a sense of belonging. <br>
My approach to therapy is wellness-oriented, person-centered and holistic. Rather than focusing solely on problems or diagnoses, I see the individuals I support through a lens of growth, resilience, and possibility. Challenges are only one part of your story and they do not define you. I aim to create space for you to rediscover your strengths and imagine what wellness looks like for you. In practice, I tailor therapy to your unique needs, drawing on evidence-based methods such as ACT, CBT, DBT, and EMDR, while also integrating creative arts to make the process engaging, rewarding and meaningful. <br>
