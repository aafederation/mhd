I am a licensed clinical social worker and an EMDR-certified therapist, utilizing multiple modalities including IFS and Mindfulness. I work with adults from diverse backgrounds with life challenges such as trauma, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and addiction. I provide a safe and non-judgmental space with compassion and focus on self-discovery, healing, and empowerment.
