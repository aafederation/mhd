Do you find it hard to say no and struggle with honest communication? Do you fall into patterns of people pleasing and fail to set healthy boundaries? Is it difficult to be yourself when around your family? Do you feel like your identity doesn’t fit neatly into a box? Are societal pressures making it difficult to live a life that is true to yourself? If you are dealing with any of these issues, I feel your pain. I’ve dealt with many of these struggles personally and supported countless clients in resolving these same challenges. As a Licensed Master Social Worker, I channel my dual-nation education from NYU’s Silver School of Social Work and Shangai into my current practice to support Asian American men who’ve lived through various experiences. My previous work as a service provider to institutionally marginalized communities in the US and China has given me space to model and explore trusting and vulnerable relationships between individuals, families, and communities. When you’re ready to find that balance between coping with society’s expectations and accepting harmony with your own, I’m here for you.
