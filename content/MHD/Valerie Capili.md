Hi! I'm Valerie and I'm a licensed clinical social worker who provides a non-judgemental and empowering space for those who are curious about gaining a deeper understanding about what they are experiencing on an individual, relational, and systemic level. I approach therapy from feminist, anti-oppressive, anti-racist, trauma-informed, intersectional and strengths-based lenses. Through the therapy space, I work to empower, give language, hold space for, and bear witness to my clients' healing journeys and life experiences. I integrate aspects of psychodynamic therapy, EMDR, CBT, DBT, motivational interviewing, and mindfulness.
