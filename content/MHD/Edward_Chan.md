As an Asian American who grew up in Texas, I understand what it can feel like to move through the world without fully feeling enough or having a true sense of belonging. Growing up between cultures shaped my understanding of identity, connection, and the unspoken pressures many people carry. These early experiences became the foundation of my own healing journey and ultimately guided me toward my work as a therapist. <br>
Grounded in this lived experience, I am a licensed therapist in the state of New York, holding a Master’s degree in Advanced Clinical Social Work from Columbia University and a Bachelor of Science in Applied Psychology from New York University. For the past decade, I have been committed to supporting individuals, couples, and families as they navigate identity, relationships, and life transitions with greater clarity and self-compassion. <br>
I have dedicated my life to learning the skills necessary not only to heal myself, but to help others cultivate a sense of belonging and develop the tools needed to move toward their hopes and aspirations, both in their relationships and in their lives. I view therapy as a collaborative space for growth, self-understanding, and meaningful change. <br>
In my practice, I strive to create a culturally responsive, affirming, and safe environment where clients feel seen, understood, and supported. Healing is not about fixing what is broken; it is about reconnecting with your strengths and moving toward a life that feels aligned, fulfilling, and authentic. <br>
