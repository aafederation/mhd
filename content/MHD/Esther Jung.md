Do you identify as a Korean American, AAPI, and/or an immigrant? A female undergoing fertility/pregnant/new mom journeys? Or a student navigating social and academic environments? Not limited to these populations, my clients navigate conflicting sub-cultures, painful upbringings that affect their adulthood, and/or complex relationships/identities while attempting to preserve self-love. I've worked with clients struggling with general anxiety, depression, past/current relational trauma, and emotional turmoil that stem from loved ones (family, social, or romantic) and in the workplace. Bilingual in Korean. <br>
Trained in EMDR, IFS and other pattern identifying modalities, my clients also appreciate the combined work of psychodynamic (look into their past) and CBT (more practical approach). By understanding one's past and applying therapeutic techniques to their present situations, clients found a sense of movement/progress/satisfaction in life. <br>
Growing up as an immigrant learning two languages and cultures, alongside my experience and training, I enjoy partnering with those who struggle with life's various complex identities/situations. Having "unconditional regard" (safe spaces) during difficult times inspire me to train to support others. <br>
