I am here to honor your lived experiences and support you on your path towards healing. I am deeply passionate about warm, relational, non-pathologizing mental healthcare, and I seek to cultivate a judgment-free space that brings your voice to the forefront. We will work together to develop a collaborative partnership that fosters shared understanding and centers your unique culture, circumstances, and values. <br>
Grounded in my Filipino heritage, my therapeutic approach emphasizes kapwa: the concept of interconnectedness, shared identity, and collective wellness. With this in mind, our work will also integrate principles of cultural affirmation, embodied healing, anti-carceral care, and transformative justice. These lenses will allow us to understand how your context impacts your well-being, and unlock what is meaningful and liberating to you. <br>
Our co-created space will invite love and compassion, whether we mend past wounds, process overwhelming emotions, or engage in self-discovery. Regardless of what you bring to our sessions, I aim to help you connect with your strengths and authenticity, while empowering you to take practical steps towards healing and growth. I'm glad that youâ€™re here and look forward to going on this journey with you! <br>
