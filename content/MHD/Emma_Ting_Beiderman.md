I am a psychoanalytically oriented and EMDR-trained therapist with availability to work in-person or remotely with individuals and couples. My approach to therapy is warm, direct, playful and engaging. I am a careful listener and strive to create an environment of openness and non-judgement. I have experience dealing with a variety of themes including relationship challenges, trauma, gender, sexuality, anxiety and overwhelming emotions, work/life balance, existential concerns, unwanted patterns of thinking/acting, race/cultural assimilation, and self-esteem. Because of my own lived experiences, I am passionate about providing affirming care to queer, gender-expansive, bi/multiracial Asian Americans who have had a difficult time finding therapists to connect with due to these intersecting identities.
