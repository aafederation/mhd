I am extremely passionate working in this field because I enjoy connecting with people and helping them to overcome obstacles in order for them to live a happier and more fulfilled life. I try to create a safe space for someone to comfortably delve into their thoughts and emotions to find the core issues they are dealing with.  I have over 18 years of experience working with individuals, couples, and families with a wide range of challenges and issues. <br>
My treatment style is primarily a client-centered approach that focuses on building trust and rapport in order for a person to feel comfortable to discuss any issues that they are having trouble with. I believe that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to mental health treatment and instead I will tailor treatment to the individual. <br>
