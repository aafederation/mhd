Our mental health is equally important as our physical well-being and I believe in creating a safe, nonjudgmental and open environment to foster personal growth. I am here to guide you through anxiety, trauma, difficulty controlling emotions and relationship issues. You’re not alone—and you don’t have to navigate it by yourself. Together, we will have a safe space to explore your thought patterns, and past traumas to help you become the best version of yourself. Growing up in a multicultural background, I understand challenges of migration, cultural issues and adapting to new environments. I am here to help.
