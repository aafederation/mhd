Hi, I’m Steph Bayan, a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist based in New York. I work with individuals, couples, and families who are navigating life’s complexities—whether you're feeling stuck in painful patterns, longing for deeper connection, or simply seeking a space to explore your story with care and curiosity. <br>
I believe that therapy is a courageous act of self-awareness, and that healing happens not just through insight, but through safe, attuned relationships. My work is rooted in the belief that we all carry inner wisdom—and sometimes we just need the right support to access it. <br>
