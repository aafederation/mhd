My goal is to create a safe and collaborative space that facilitates self-exploration and personal growth for my clients. Through a strengths-based, culturally sensitive, and client-centered approach to therapy, I help clients construct and navigate a path toward healing and wellbeing that honors their individual needs and objectives. I also work with couples to help them find greater connection with each other and develop stronger communication and conflict resolution skills. <br>
I earned my Master’s in Mental Health and Wellness from New York University and completed a comprehensive two-year post-graduate training in Trauma Studies at The Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy. My clinical training includes an internship at Mt. Sinai-St. Luke’s Crime Victims Treatment Center (CVTC), where I worked with survivors of interpersonal violence, sexual assault, child sexual abuse, and human trafficking. <br>
Before becoming a therapist, I worked as an organizational consultant with Fortune 500 companies, helping them build values-based cultures. I hold a Doctorate in Organizational Psychology from Columbia University and a Bachelor's with Honors in Human Development from Cornell University. <br>
