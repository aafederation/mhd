I am an Asian and mixed-race therapist with over a decade of experience helping clients navigate challenges related to perfectionism, self-esteem, and cultural identity. I specialize in working with professionals, often from multicultural backgrounds, who are seeking to improve their relationships, manage anxiety, and build self-compassion. My approach is warm, culturally sensitive, and focused on fostering personal growth while honoring each client's unique values and experiences.
